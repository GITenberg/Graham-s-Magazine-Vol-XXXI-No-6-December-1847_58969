<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> the first conception of the institution of chivalry
it was doubtless a device of great purity, and contemplated
none but highly proper and becoming
purposes. Those very features which, in our more
sophisticated era, seem to have been the most absurd,
or at least fantastic, were, perhaps among its
best securities. The sentiment of love, apart from
its passion, is what a very earnest people, in a very
selfish period, cannot so well understand; but it
was this very separation of interests, which we now
hold to be inseparable, that constituted the peculiarity
of chivalry—the fanciful in its characteristics
rendering sentiment independent of passion, and
refining the crude desire by the exercise and influence
of tastes, which do not usually accompany it.
Among the Provençal knights and troubadours, in
the palmy days of their progress, love was really
the most innocent and the most elevated of sentiments.
It seems to have been nursed without guile,
and was professed, even when seemingly in conflict
with the rights of others, without the slightest
notion of wrong doing or offence. It did not vex
the temper, or impair the marital securities of the
husband, that the beauties of his dame were sung
with enthusiasm by the youthful poet; on the contrary,
he who gloried in the possession of a jewel,
was scarcely satisfied with fortune unless she
brought to a just knowledge of its splendors, the
bard who alone could convey to the world a similar
sense of the value of his treasure. The narrative
which we have gathered from the ancient chronicles
of Provence, and which we take occasion to
say is drawn from the most veracious sources of
history, will illustrate the correctness of these particulars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the most remarkable instances of the sentiment
of love, warmed into passion, yet without
evil in its objects, is to be found in the true and
touching history of Guillaume de Cabestaign, a noble
youth of Roussillon. Though noble of birth, Guillaume
was without fortune, and it was not thought
improper or humiliating in those days that he should
serve, as a page, the knight whose ancestors were
known to his own as associates. It was in this
capacity that he became the retainer of Raymond,
Lord of Roussillon. Raymond, though a haughty
baron, was one who possessed certain generous
tastes and sentiments, and who showed himself
capable of appreciating the talents and great merits
of Guillaume de Cabestaign. His endowments, indeed
were of a character to find ready favor with
all parties. The youth was not only graceful of
carriage, and particularly handsome of face and
person, but he possessed graces of mind and manner
which especially commended him to knightly
sympathy and admiration. He belonged to that
class of <span class='it'>improvisatori</span> to whom the people of Provence
gave the name of troubadour, and was quite
as ready to sing the praises of his mistress, as he
was to mount horse, and charge with sword and
lance in her defence and honor. His muse, taking
her moral aspect from his own, was pure and
modest in her behavior—indulging in no song or
sentiment which would not fall becomingly on the
most virgin ear. His verses were distinguished
equally by their delicacy and fancy, and united to a
spirit of the most generous and exulting life a taste
of the utmost simplicity and purity. Not less gentle
than buoyant, he was at once timid in approach,
and joy-giving in society; and while he compelled
the respect of men by his frank and fearless manhood,
he won the hearts of the other sex by those
gentle graces which, always prompt and ready, are
never obtrusive, and which leave us only to the
just appreciation of their value, when they are withdrawn
from our knowledge and enjoyment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened, unfortunately for our troubadour,
that he won too many hearts. Raised by the Lord
of Roussillon to the rank of gentleman usher to the
Lady Marguerite, his young and beautiful wife,
the graces and accomplishments of Guillaume de
Cabestaign, soon became quite as apparent and
agreeable to her as to the meanest of the damsels
in her train. She was never so well satisfied as in
his society; and her young and ardent soul, repelled
rather than solicited by the stern nature of Raymond,
her lord, was better prepared and pleased to
sympathize with the more beguiling and accessible
spirit of the page. The tenderest impressions of
love, without her own knowledge, soon seized
upon her heart; and she had learned to sigh as she
gazed upon the person that she favored, long before
she entertained the slightest consciousness that he
was at all precious to her eyes. He himself, dutiful
as devoted, for a long season beheld none of these
proofs of favor on the part of his noble mistress.
She called him her servant, it is true, and he as
such, sung daily in her praises the equal language
of the lover and the knight. These were words,
however, of specific and conventional meaning, to
which her husband listened with indifferent ear.
In those days every noble lady entertained a lover,
who was called her servant. It was a prerogative
of nobility that such should be the case. It spoke
for the courtliness and aristocracy of the party; and
to be without a lover, though in the possession of a
husband, was to be an object of scornful sympathy
in the eyes of the sex. Fashion, in other words,
had taken the name of chivalry; and it was one of
her regulations that the noble lady should possess
a lover, who should of necessity be other than her
lord. In this capacity, Raymond of Roussillon, found
nothing of which to complain in the devotion of
Guillaume de Cabestaign to Marguerite, his wife.
But the courtiers who gathered in her train were
not so indulgent, or were of keener sight. They
soon felt the preference which she gave, over all
others, to our troubadour. They felt, and they resented
it the more readily, as they were not insensible
to his personal superiority. Guillaume himself,
was exceeding slow in arriving at a similar
consciousness. Touched with a fonder sentiment
for his mistress than was compatible with his
security, his modesty had never suffered him to
suppose that he had been so fortunate as to inspire
her with a feeling such as he now knew within
himself. It was at a moment when he least looked
for it, that he made the perilous discovery. It was
in the course of a discussion upon the various signs
of love—such a discussion as occupied the idle
hours, and the wandering fancies of chivalry—that
she said to him, somewhat abruptly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely thou, Guillaume, thou, who canst sing of
love so tenderly, and with so much sweetness, thou,
of all persons, should be the one to distinguish between
a feigned passion and a real one. Methinks
the eye of him who loves truly, could most certainly
discover from the eye of the beloved one, whether
the real flame were yet burning in her heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And even as she spoke, the glance of her dark
and lustrous eye settled upon his own with such a
dewy and quivering fire, that his soul at once became
enlightened with her secret. The troubadour
was necessarily an <span class='it'>improvisatore</span>. Guillaume de
Cabestaign was admitted to be one of the most
spontaneous in his utterance of all his order. His
lyre took for him the voice which he could not well
have used at that overpowering moment. He sung
wildly and triumphantly, inspired by his new and
rapturous consciousness, even while her eyes were
yet fixed upon him, full still of the involuntary declaration
which made the inspiration of his song. These
verses, which embodied the first impulsive sentiment
which he had ever dared to breathe from his heart of
the passion which had long been lurking within it,
have been preserved for us by the damsels of Provence.
We translate them, necessarily to the great
detriment of their melody, from the sweet South,
where they had birth, to our harsher Runic region.
The song of Guillaume was an apostrophe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a poem is beyond analysis. It was simply
a gush of enthusiasm—the lyrical overflow of sentiment
and passion, such as a song should be always.
The reader will easily understand that the delicacy
of the tune, the epigrammatic intenseness of the
expression, is totally lost in the difficulty of subjugating
our more stubborn language to the uses of
the poet. A faint and inferior idea of what was
said, sung at this moment of wild and almost spasmodical
utterance, is all that we design to convey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spot in which this scene took place was
amid the depth of umbrageous trees, in the beautiful
garden of Chateau Roussillon. A soft and persuasive
silence hung suspended in the atmosphere.
Not a leaf stirred, not a bird chirruped in the foliage;
and however passionate was the sentiment expressed
by the troubadour, it scarcely rose beyond
a whisper—harmonizing in the subdued utterance,
and the sweet delicacy of its sentiment with the exquisite
repose and languor of the scene. Carried
beyond herself by the emotions of the moment, the
feeling of Marguerite became so far irresistible that
she stooped ere the song of the troubadour had
subsided from the ear, and pressed her lips upon
the forehead of her kneeling lover. He seized her
hand at this moment and carried it to his own
lips, in an equally involuntary impulse. This act
awakened the noble lady to a just consciousness of
her weakness. She at once recoiled from his grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas!” she exclaimed, with clasped hands,
“what have I done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, lady!” was the answer of the troubadour,
“it is thy goodness which has at length discovered
how my heart is devoted to thee. It is thy truth,
and thy nobleness, dear lady, which I love and
worship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By these shalt thou know me ever, Guillaume
of Cabestaign,” was the response; “and yet I warn
thee,” she continued, “I warn and I entreat thee,
dear servant, that thou approach me not so near
again. Thou hast shown to me, and surprised from
me, a most precious but an unhappy secret. Thou
hast, too, deeply found thy way into my heart.
Alas! wherefore! wherefore!” and the eyes of the
amiable and virtuous woman were suffused with
tears, as her innocent soul trembled under the
reproaches of her jealous conscience. She continued,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot help but love thee, Guillaume of Cabestaign,
but it shall never be said that the love of
the Lady Marguerite of Roussillon was other than
became the wife of her lord. Thou, too, shall know
me by love only, Guillaume; but it shall be such a
love as shall work neither of us trespass. Yet do
not thou cease to love me as before, for, of a truth,
dear servant, the affections of thy heart are needful
to the life of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of the troubadour was only in his lyre.
At all his events, his reply has been only preserved
to us in song. It was in the fullness of his joy that
he again poured forth his melody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It does not appear that love trespassed in this instance
beyond the sweet but narrow boundaries of
sentiment. The lovers met daily, as usual, secretly
as well as publicly, and their professions of attachment
were frankly made in the hearing of the world;
but the vows thus spoken were not articulated any
longer in that formal, conventional phraseology and
manner, which, in fact, only mocked the passion
which it affectedly professed. It was soon discovered
that the songs of Guillaume de Cabestaign
were no longer the frigid effusions of mere gallantry,
the common, stilt style of artifice and commonplace.
There was life, and blood, and a rare enthusiasm
in his lyrics. His song was no longer a thing of
air, floating, as it had done, on the winglets of a
simple fancy, but a living and a burning soul, borne
upward and forward, by the gales of an intense and
earnest passion. It was seen, that when the poet and
his noble mistress spoke together, the tones of their
voices mutually trembled as if with a strange and
eager sympathy. When they met, it was noted
that their eyes seemed to dart at once into each
other, with the intensity of two wedded fires, which
high walls would vainly separate, and which, however
sundered, show clearly that they will overleap
their bounds, and unite themselves in one at last.
Theirs was evidently no simulated passion. It was
too certainly real, as well in other eyes as their
own. The world, though ignorant of the mutual
purity of their hearts, were yet quick enough to
discern what were their real sentiments. They saw
the affections of which they soon learned, naturally
enough, to conjecture the worst only. The rage of
rivals, the jealousy of inferiors, the spite of the
envious, the malice of the wantonly scandalous,
readily found cause of evil where in reality offence
was none. To conceive the crime, was to convey
the cruel suspicion, as a certainty, to the mind of
him whom the supposed offence most affected.
Busy tongues soon assailed the ears of the Lord of
Roussillon, in relation to his wife. They whispered
him to watch the lovers—to remark the eager intimacy
of their eyes—the tremulous sweetness of
their voices, and their subdued tones whenever
they met—the frequency of their meetings—the
reluctance with which they separated; and they
dwelt with emphasis upon the pointed and passionate
declarations, the intensity and ardor of the
sentiments which now filled the songs of the troubadour—so
very different from what they had ever
been before. In truth, the new passion of Guillaume
had wrought wondrously in favor of his music.
He who had been only a clever and dextrous imitator
of the artificial strains of other poets, had
broken down all the fetters of convention, and now
poured forth the most natural and original poetry of
his own, greatly to the increase of his reputation as
a troubadour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Raymond de Roussillon hearkened to these suggestions
in silence, and with a gloomy heart. He
loved his wife truly, as far as it was possible for him
to love. He was a stern, harsh man, fond of the
chase, of the toils of chivalry rather than its sports;
was cold in his own emotions, and with an intense
self-esteem, that grew impatient under every sort of
rivalry. It was not difficult to impress him with
evil thoughts, even where he had bestowed his confidence;
and to kindle his mind with the most
terrible suspicions of the unconsciously offending
parties. Once aroused, the dark, stern man, resolved
to avenge his supposed wrong; and hearing
one day that Guillaume had gone out hawking, and
alone, he hastily put on his armor, concealing it
under his courtly and silken vestments, took his
weapon, and rode forth in the direction which the
troubadour had taken. He overtook the latter after
a while, upon the edge of a little river that wound
slowly through a wood. Guillaume de Cabestaign
approached his lord without any misgiving; but as
he drew near, a certain indefinable something in
the face of Raymond, inspired a feeling of anxiety
in his mind, and, possibly, the secret consciousness
in his own bosom, added to his uneasiness. He remembered
that it was not often that great lords
thus wandered forth unattended; and the path which
Raymond pursued was one that Guillaume had
taken because of its obscurity, and with the desire
to find a solitude in which he might brood securely
over his own secret fancies and affections. His
doubts thus awakened, our troubadour prepared to
guard his speech. He boldly approached his superior,
however, and was the first to break silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You here, my lord, and alone! How does this
chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Guillaume,” answered the other, mildly,
“I heard that you were here, and hawking, and resolved
to share your amusement. What has been
your sport?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, my lord. I have scarcely seen a single
bird; and you remember the proverb—‘Who finds
nothing, takes not much.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artlessness and simplicity of the troubadour’s
speech and manner, for the first time, inspired some
doubts in the mind of Raymond, whether he could
be so guilty as his enemies had reported him. His
purpose, when he came forth that morning, had
been to ride the supposed offender down, whenever
he encountered him, and to thrust his boar-spear
through his body. Such was the summary justice
of the feudal baron. Milder thoughts had suddenly
possessed him. If Raymond of Roussillon was a
stern man, jealous of his honor, and prompt in his
resentment, he at least desired to be a just man;
and a lurking doubt of the motives of those by whom
the troubadour had been slandered, now determined
him to proceed more deliberately in the work of
justice. He remembered the former confidence
which he had felt in the fidelity of the page, and he
was not insensible to the charm of his society.
Every sentence which had been spoken since their
meeting, had tended to make him hesitate before
he hurried to judgment in a matter where it was
scarcely possible to repair the wrong which a rash
and hasty vengeance might commit. By this time,
they had entered the wood together, and were now
concealed from all human eyes. The Lord of
Roussillon alighted from his horse, and motioned
his companion to seat himself beside him in the
shade. When both were seated, and, after a brief
pause, Raymond addressed the troubadour in the
following language:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guillaume de Cabestaign,” said he, “be sure I
came not hither this day to talk to you of birds and
hawking, but of something more serious. Now, look
upon me, and as a true and loyal servant, see that
thou answer honestly to all that I shall ask of
thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The troubadour was naturally impressed by the
stern simplicity and solemnity of this exordium.
He was not unaware that, as the knight had alighted
from his steed, he had done so heavily, and under
the impediment of concealed armor. His doubts
and anxieties were necessarily increased by this
discovery, but so also was his firmness. He left
that much depended upon his coolness and address,
and he steeled himself, with all his soul, to the trial
which was before him. The recollection of Marguerite,
and of her fate and reputation depending
upon his own, was the source of no small portion
of his present resolution. His reflections were instantaneous;
there was no unreasonable delay in
his answer, which was at once manly and circumspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not what you aim at or intend, my lord,
but, by heaven! I swear to you that, if it be proper
for me to answer you in that you seek, I will keep
nothing from your knowledge that you desire to
know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, Guillaume,” replied the knight, “I will
have no conditions. You shall reply honestly, and
without reserve, to all the questions I shall put
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hear them, my lord—command me, as
you have the right,” was the reply of the troubadour,
“and I will answer you, with my conscience, as
far as I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would then know from you,” responded Raymond,
very solemnly, “on your faith, and by your
God, whether the verses that you make are inspired
by a real passion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A warm flush passed over the cheeks of the
troubadour; the pride of the artist was offended by
the inquiry. That it should be questioned whether
he really felt what he so passionately declared, was
a disparaging judgment upon the merits of his song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my lord,” was the reply, expressed with
some degree of mortification, “how could I sing as
I do, unless I really felt all the passion which
I declare. In good sooth, then, I tell you, love has
the entire possession of my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, verily, I believe thee, Guillaume,” was the
subdued answer of the baron; “I believe thee, my
friend, for unless a real passion was at his heart, no
troubadour could ever sing as thou. But, something
more of thee, Guillaume de Cabestaign.
Prithee, now, declare to me the name of the lady
whom thy verses celebrate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was that the cheek of our troubadour
grew pale, and his heart sunk within him; but the
piercing eye of the baron was upon him. He had
no moment for hesitation. To falter now, he was
well assured, was to forfeit love, life, and every
thing that was proud and precious in his sight. In
the moment of exigency the troubadour found his
answer. It was evasive, but adroitly conceived and
expressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my lord, will it please you to consider?
I appeal to your own heart and honour—can any
one, without perfidy, declare such a secret? Reveal
a thing that involves the rights and the reputation
of another, and that other a lady of good fame and
quality? Well must you remember what is said on
this subject by the very master of our art, no less a
person than the excellent Bernard de Ventadour.
He should know—what says he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baron remained silent, while Guillaume repeated
the following verses of the popular troubadour,
whose authority he appealed to:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“The loyal lover sees the snare,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;And neither to the waves nor air,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“The duty that to love we owe,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;Is, while to her we all may show,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Though seemingly well adapted to his objects, the
quotation of our troubadour was unfortunate. There
were yet other verses to this instructive ditty, and
the Baron of Roussillon, who had listened very
patiently as his companion recited the preceding,
soon proved himself to have a memory for good
songs, though he never pretended to make them
himself. When Guillaume had fairly finished, he
took up the strain after a brief introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is all very right and very proper, Guillaume,
and I gainsay not a syllable that Master Bernard
hath written; nay, methinks my proper answer to
thee lieth in another of his verses, which thou
shouldst not have forgotten while reminding me of
its companions. I shall refresh thy memory with
the next that follows.” And without waiting for any
answer, the baron proceeded to repeat another
stanza of the old poem, in very creditable style and
manner for an amateur. This remark Guillaume
de Cabestaign could not forbear making to himself,
though he was conscious at the same time that the
utterance of the baron was in singularly slow and
subdued accents—accents that scarcely rose above
a whisper, and which were timed as if every syllable
were weighed and spelled, ere it was confided to
expression. The verse was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“We yield her name to those alone,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;Who, when the sacred truth is shown,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;May help to make the maid our own.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, methinks,” continued the baron, “here
lieth the wisdom of my quest. Who better than
myself can help to secure thee thy desires, to promote
thy passion, and gain for thee the favor of the
fair? Tell me, then, I command thee, Guillaume, and
I promise to help thee with my best efforts and
advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was a dilemma. The troubadour was foiled
with his own weapons. The quotation from his
own authority was conclusive against him. The
argument of Raymond was irresistible. Of his
ability to serve the young lover there could be no
question; and as little could the latter doubt the
readiness of that friendship—assuming his pursuit
to be a proper one—to which he had been so long
indebted for favor and protection. He could excuse
himself by no further evasion; and having admitted
that he really and deeply loved, and that his verses
declared a real and living passion, it became absolutely
necessary that our troubadour, unless he
would confirm the evident suspicions of his lord,
should promptly find for her a name. He did so.
The emergency seemed to justify a falsehood; and,
with firm accents, Guillaume did not scruple to declare
himself devoted, heart and soul, to the beautiful
Lady Agnes de Tarrascon, the sister of Marguerite,
his real mistress. At the pressing solicitation
of Raymond, and in order to render applicable
to this case certain of his verses, he admitted himself
to have received from this lady certain favoring
smiles, upon which his hopes of future happiness
were founded. Our troubadour was persuaded to
select the name of this lady, over all others, for two
reasons. He believed that she suspected, or somewhat
knew of the mutual flame which existed between
himself and her sister; and he had long been
conscious of that benevolence of temper which the
former possessed, and which he fondly thought would
prompt her in some degree to sympathize with him
in his necessity, and lend herself somewhat to his
own and the extrication of Marguerite. After
making his confession, he concluded by imploring
Raymond to approach his object cautiously, and
by no means to peril his fortunes in the esteem of
the lady he professed to love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the difficulties of Guillaume de Cabestaign
were only begun. It was not the policy of Raymond
to be satisfied with his simple asseverations. The
suspicions which had been awakened in his mind
by the malignant suggestions of his courtiers, were
too deeply and skillfully infixed there, to suffer him
to be soothed by the mere statement of the supposed
offender. He required something of a confirmatory
character from the lips of Lady Agnes herself.
Pleased, nevertheless, at what he had heard, and at
the readiness and seeming frankness with which the
troubadour had finally yielded his secret to his
keeping, he eagerly assured the latter of his assistance
in the prosecution of his quest; and he, who a
moment before had coolly contemplated a deliberate
murder, to revenge a supposed wrong to his own
honor, did not now scruple to profess his willingness
to aid his companion in compassing the dishonor of
another. It did not matter much to our sullen
baron that the victim was the sister of his own wife.
The human nature of Lord Raymond of Roussillon,
his own dignity uninjured, had but little sympathy
with his neighbor’s rights and sensibilities. He
promptly proposed, at that very moment, to proceed
on his charitable mission. The castle of
Tarrascon was in sight; and, pointing to its turrets,
that rose loftily above the distant hills, the imperious
finger of Raymond gave the direction to our troubadour,
which he shuddered to pursue, but did not
dare to decline. He now began to feel all the
dangers and embarrassments which he was about
to encounter, and to tremble at the disgrace and
ruin which seemed to rise, threatening and dead
before him. Never was woman more virtuous
than the Lady Agnes. Gentle and beautiful, like
her sister Marguerite, her reputation had been more
fortunate in escaping wholly the assaults of the
malignant. She had always shown an affectionate
indulgence for our troubadour, and a delighted interest
in his various accomplishments; and he now
remembered all her goodness and kindness only to
curse himself, in his heart, for the treachery of
which he had just been guilty. His remorse at
what he had said to Raymond, was not the less
deep and distressing from the conviction that he
felt, that there had been no other way left him of
escape from his dilemma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are bound to believe that the eagerness which
Raymond of Roussillon now exhibited was not so
much because of a desire to bring about the dishonor
of another, as to be perfectly satisfied that he himself
was free from injury. At the Castle of Tarrascon,
the Lady Agnes was found alone. She gave the
kindest reception to her guests; and, anxious to behold
things through the medium of his wishes rather
than his doubts and fears, Raymond fancied that
there was a peculiar sort of tenderness in the tone
and spirit of the compliments which she addressed
to the dejected troubadour. That he was disquieted
and dejected she was soon able to discover. His
uneasiness made itself apparent before they had
been long together; and the keen intelligence of
the feminine mind was accordingly very soon prepared
to comprehend the occasion of his disquiet,
when drawn aside by Raymond at the earliest opportunity,
she found herself cross-examined by the
impatient baron on the nature and object of her own
affections. A glance of the eye at Guillaume de
Cabestaign, as she listened to the inquiries of the
suspicious Raymond, revealed to the quick-witted
woman the extent of his apprehensions, and possibly
the danger of her sister. Her ready instinct and
equally prompt benevolence of heart, at once decided
all the answers of the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why question me of lovers,” she replied to
Raymond, with a pretty querulousness of tone
and manner, “certainly, I have lovers enow, as
many as I choose to have. Would you that I should
live unlike other women of birth and quality, without
my servant to sing my praises, and declare his
readiness to die in my behalf?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, ay, my lady,” answered the knight, “lovers,
I well know, you possess; for of these, I trow, that
no lady of rank and beauty such as yours, can or
possibly should be without; but is there not one
lover over all whom you not only esteem for his
grace and service, but for whom you feel the tenderest
interest, whom, in fact, you prefer to the
full surrender of your whole heart, and were this
possible or proper, of your whole person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the gentle lady hesitated in her
answer. The question was one of a kind to startle
a delicate and faithful spirit; but, as her eyes wandered
off to the place where the troubadour stood
trembling—as she detected the pleading terror that
was apparent in his face—her benevolence got the
better of her scruples, and she frankly admitted
that there really was one person in the world for
whom her sentiments were even thus lively, and
her sympathies thus broad and active.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, I beseech you, Lady Agnes,” urged
the anxious baron, “that you deal with me like a
brother who will joy to serve you, and declare to
me the name of the person whom you so much
favor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, out upon it, my Lord of Roussillon;” was
the quick and somewhat indignant reply of the lady,
“that you should presume thus greatly upon the
kindred that lies between us. Women are not to
be constrained to make such confession as this. It
is their prerogative to be silent when the safety of
their affections may suffer from their speech. To
urge them to confess, in such cases, is only to compel
them to speak unnecessary falsehoods. And know
I not you husbands all—you have but a feeling in
common; and if I reveal myself to you, it were as
well that I should go at once and make full confession
to my own lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, dearest Lady Agnes, have no such doubt
of my loyalty. I will assure you that what you tell
me never finds its way to the ear of your lord. I
pray thee do not fear to make this confession to me;
nay, but thou must, Agnes,” exclaimed the rude
baron, his voice rising more earnestly, and his
manner becoming passionate and stern, while he
grasped her wrist firmly in his convulsive fingers,
and drawing her toward him, added, in the subdued
but intense tones of half-suppressed passion, “I tell
thee, lady, it behooves me much to know this
secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady did not immediately yield, though the
manner of Raymond, from this moment, determined
her that she would do so. She now conjectured
all the circumstances of the case, and felt the necessity
of saving the troubadour for the sake of her
sister. But she played with the excited baron
awhile longer, and when his passion grew so impatient
as to be almost beyond his control, she admitted,
as a most precious secret, confided to his
keeping only that he might serve her in its gratification,
that she had a burning passion for Guillaume
de Cabestaign, of which he himself was probably
not conscious. The invention of the lady was as
prompt and accurate as if the troubadour had
whispered at her elbow. Raymond was now satisfied.
He was relieved of his suspicions, turned
away from the Lady of Tarrascon, to embrace her
supposed lover, and readily accepted an invitation
from the former, for himself and companion, to remain
that night to supper. At that moment the
great gates of the castle was thrown open, and the
Lord of Tarrascon made his appearance. He confirmed
the invitation extended by his wife; and, as
usual, gave a most cordial reception to his guests.
As soon as an opportunity offered, and before the
hour of supper arrived, the Lady Agnes contrived
to withdraw her lord to her own apartments, and
there frankly revealed to him all that had taken
place. He cordially gave his sanction to all that
she had done. Guillaume de Cabestaign was much
more of a favorite than his jealous master; and the
sympathies of the noble and the virtuous, in those
days, were always accorded to those who professed
a love so innocent as, it was justly believed
by this noble couple, was that of the Lady Marguerite
and the troubadour. The harsh suspicions
of Raymond were supposed to characterize only a
coarse and brutal nature, which, in the assertion
of its unquestionable rights, would abridge all those
freedoms which courtliness and chivalry had established
for the pleasurable intercourse of other
parties. A perfect understanding thus established
between the wife and husband, in behalf of the
troubadour, and in misleading the baron, these
several persons sat down to supper in the rarest
good humor and harmony. Guillaume de Cabestaign
recovered all his confidence, and with it his inspiration.
He made several improvisations during
the evening, which delighted the company—all in
favor of the Lady Agnes, and glimpsing faintly at
his attachment for her. These, unhappily, have not
been preserved to us. They are said to have been
so made as to correspond to the exigency of his recent
situation; the excellent Baron Raymond all the
while supposing that he alone possessed the key to
their meaning. The Lady Agnes, meanwhile, under
the approving eye of her husband, was at special
pains to show such an interest in the troubadour,
and such a preference for his comfort, over that of
all persons present, as contributed to confirm all
the assurances she had given to her brother-in-law
in regard to her affections. The latter saw this
with perfect satisfaction; and leaving Guillaume to
pass the night where he was so happily entertained,
he hurried home to Roussillon, eager to reveal to
his own wife, the intrigue between her lover and
her sister. It is quite possible that, if his suspicions
of the troubadour were quieted, he still entertained
some with regard to Marguerite. It is not improbable
that a conviction that he was giving pain at
every syllable he uttered entered into his calculations,
and prompted what he said. He might be
persuaded of the innocence of the parties, yet
doubtful of their affections; and though assured
now that he was mistaken in respect to the tendency
of those of Guillaume, his suspicions were
still lively in regard to those of his wife. His present
revelations might be intended to probe her to
the quick, and to gather from her emotions, at his
recital, in how much she was interested in the sympathies
of the troubadour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How far he succeeded in diving into her secret,
has not been confided to the chronicle. It is very
certain, however, that he succeeded in making
Marguerite very unhappy. She now entertained
no doubt, after her husband’s recital, of the treachery
of her sister, and the infidelity of her lover; and
though she herself had permitted him no privilege,
inconsistent with the claims of her lord, she was
yet indignant that he should have proved unfaithful
to a heart which he so well knew to be thoroughly
his own. The pure soul itself entirely devoted to
the beloved object, thus always revolts at a consciousness
of its fall from its purity and its pledges;
and though itself denied—doomed only to a secret
worship, to which no altar may be raised, and to
which there is no offering but the sacrifice of constant
privation—yet it greatly prefers to entertain
this sacred sense of isolation, to any enjoyment of
mere mortal happiness. To feel that our affections
are thus isolated in vain; that we have yielded
them to one who is indifferent to the trust, and
lives still for his earthly passions, is to suffer from
a more than mortal deprivation. Marguerite of
Roussillon passed the night in extreme agony of
mind, the misery of which was greatly aggravated
by the necessity, in her husband’s presence, of suppressing
every feeling of uneasiness. But her feelings
could not always be suppressed; and when, the
next day, on the return of the troubadour from
Tarrascon, she encountered him in those garden
walks which had been made sacred to their passion
by its first mutual revelation, the pang grew to
utterance, which her sense of dignity and propriety
in vain endeavored to subdue. Her eyes brightened
indignantly through her tears; and she whose
virtue had withheld every gift of passion from the
being whom she yet professed to love, at once, but
still most tenderly, reproached him with his infidelity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! Guillaume,” she continued, after telling
him all that she had heard, “alas! that my soul
should have so singled thine out from all the rest,
because of its purity, and should find thee thus, like
all the rest, incapable of a sweet and holy love such
as thou didst promise. I had rather died, Guillaume,
a thousand deaths, than that thou shouldst have
fallen from thy faith to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have not fallen—I have not faltered in my
faith, Marguerite! I am still true to thee—to thee
only, though I sigh for thee vainly, and know that
thou livest only for another. Hear me, Marguerite,
while I tell thee what has truly happened. Thou
hast heard something, truly, but not all the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he proceeded with the narrative to which we
have already listened. He had only to show her
what had passed between her lord and himself, to
show how great had been his emergency. The
subsequent events at Tarrascon, only convinced
her of the quick intelligence, and sweet benevolence
of purpose by which her sister had been governed.
Her charitable sympathies had seen and favored
the artifice in which lay the safety equally of her
lover and herself. The revulsion of her feelings
from grief to exultation, spoke in a gust of tears,
which relieved the distresses of her soul. The
single kiss upon his forehead, with which she rewarded
the devotion of the troubadour, inspired his
fancy. He made the event the subject of a sonnet,
which has fortunately been preserved to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines first italicized embody the name of the
lady, by a periphrasis known to the Provençal dialect,
and the name of the daisy, as used in the
closing line, is Marguerite’s. The poem is an
unequivocal declaration of attachment, obviously
meant to do away with all adverse declarations.
To those acquainted with the previous history, it
unfolds another history quite as significant; and to
those who knew nothing of the purity of the parties,
and who made no allowance for the exaggerated
manner in which a troubadour would be apt to declare
the privileges he had enjoyed, it would convey
the idea of a triumph inconsistent with the innocence
of the lovers, and destructive of the rights
of the injured husband. Thus, full of meaning, it
is difficult to conceive by what imprudence of the
parties, this fatal sonnet found its way to the hands
of Raymond of Roussillon. It is charged by the
biographers, in the absence of other proofs, that the
vanity of Marguerite, in her moments of exultation—greater
than her passion—proud of the homage
which she inspired, and confident in the innocence
which the world had too slanderously already begun
to question—could not forbear the temptation of
showing so beautiful a testimony of the power of
her charms. But the suggestion lacks in plausibility.
It is more easy to conceive that the fond
heart of the woman would not suffer her to destroy
so exquisite a tribute, and that the jealousy of her
lord, provoked by the arts of envious rivals, conducted
him to the place of safe-keeping where her
treasure was concealed. At all events, it fell into
his hands, and revived all his suspicions. In fact, it
gave the lie to the artful story by which he had been
lulled into confidence, and was thus, in a manner,
conclusive of the utter guilt of the lovers. His
pride was outraged as well as his honor. He had
been gulled by all upon whom he had relied—his
wife, his page, and his sister. He no longer doubted
Marguerite’s infidelity and his own disgrace; and
breathing nothing but vengeance, he yet succeeded
in concealing from all persons the convictions which
he felt, of the guilt which dishonored him, and the
terrible vengeance which he meditated for its
punishment. He was a cold and savage man, who
could suppress, in most cases, the pangs which he
felt, and could deliberately restrain the passions
which yet occupied triumphant places in his heart
and purpose. It was not long before he found the
occasion which he desired. The movements of the
troubadour were closely watched, and one day
when he had wandered forth from the castle, seeking
solitude, as was his frequent habit, Raymond
contrived to steal away from observation, and to
follow him out into the forest. He was successful
in his quest. He found Guillaume resting at the
foot of a shady tree, in a secluded glen, with his
tablets before him. The outlines of a tender ballad,
tender but spiritual, as was the character of all his
melodies, were already inscribed upon the paper.
The poet was meditating, as usual, the charms of
that dangerous mistress, whose beauty was destined
to become his bane. Raymond threw himself upon
the ground beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! well,” said he, as he joined the troubadour,
“this love of the Lady Agnes is still a distressing
matter in thy thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In truth, my lord, I think of her with the greatest
love and tenderness,” was the reply of Guillaume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verily, thou dost well,” returned the baron;
“she deserves requital at thy hands. Thou owest
her good service. And yet, for one who so greatly
affects a lady, and who hath found so much favor in
her sight, methinks thou seek’st her but seldom.
Why is this, Sir Troubadour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting for the answer, Raymond added,
“But let me see what thou hast just written in her
praise. It is by his verses that we understand the
devotion of the troubadour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaning over the poet as he spoke, as if his purpose
had been to possess himself of his tablets, he
suddenly threw the whole weight of his person
upon him, and, in the very same moment, by a quick
movement of the hand, he drove the <span class='it'>couteau de
chasse</span>, with which he was armed, and which he had
hitherto concealed behind him, with a swift, unerring
stroke deep down into the bosom of the victim.
Never was blow better aimed, or with more energy
delivered. The moment of danger was that of
death. The unfortunate troubadour was conscious
of the weapon only when he felt the steel. It was
with a playful smile that Raymond struck, and so
innocent was the expression of his face, even while
his arm was extended and the weight of his body
was pressing upon Guillaume, that the only solicitude
of the latter had been to conceal his tablets.
One convulsive cry, one hideous contortion, and
Guillaume de Cabestaign was no more. The name
of Marguerite was the only word which escaped
him with his dying shriek. The murderer placed
his hand upon the heart of the victim. It had
already ceased to beat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wilt mock me no more!” he muttered
fiercely, as he half rose from the body now stiffening
fast. But his fierce vengeance was by no means
completed. As if a new suggestion had seized upon
his mind, while his hand rested upon the heart of
the troubadour, he suddenly started and tore away
the garments from the unconscious bosom. Once
more he struck it deeply with the keen and heavy
blade. In a few moments he had laid it open. Then
he plunged his naked hand into the gaping wound,
and tore out the still quivering heart. This he
wrapped up with care, and concealed in his garments.
With another stroke he smote the head
from the body, and this he also concealed, in fragments
torn from the person of his victim. With
these proofs of his terrible revenge, he made his
way, under cover of the dusk, in secret to the castle.
What remains to be told is still more dreadful—beyond
belief indeed, were it not that the sources of
our history are wholly above discredit or denial.
The cruel baron, ordering his cook into his presence,
then gave the heart of the troubadour into his keeping,
with instructions to dress it richly, and after a
manner of dressing certain favorite portions of venison,
of which Marguerite was known to be particularly
fond. The dish was a subject of special
solicitude with her husband. He himself superintended
the preparation, and furnished the spices.
That night, he being her only companion at the feast,
it was served up to his wife, at the usual time of
supper. He had assiduously subdued every vestige
of anger, unkindness or suspicion from his countenance.
Marguerite was suffered to hear and see
nothing which might provoke her apprehensions or
arrest her appetite. She was more than usually
serene and cheerful, as, that day and evening, her
lord was more than commonly indulgent. He, too,
could play a part when it suited him to do so; and,
like most men of stern will and great experience,
could adapt his moods and manners to that livelier
cast, and more pliant temper, which better persuade
the feminine heart into confidence and pleasure.
He smiled upon her now with the most benevolent
sweetness; but while he earnestly encouraged her
to partake of the delicacy specially put before her,
he himself might be seen to eat of any other dish.
The wretched woman, totally unsuspicious of guile
or evil, undreaming of disaster, and really conscious
of but little self-reproach, ate freely of the precious
meat which had been placed before her. The eyes
of Raymond greedily followed every morsel which
she carried to her lips. She evidently enjoyed the
dish which had been spiced for her benefit, and as
she continued to draw upon it, he could no longer
forbear to unfold the exultation which he felt at the
entire satisfaction of his vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem very much to like your meats to-night,
Marguerite. Do you find them good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Verily,” she answered, “this venison is really
delicious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat then,” he continued, “I have had it dressed
purposely for you. You ought to like it. It is a
dish of which you have always shown yourself very
fond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my lord, but you surely err. I cannot
think that I have ever eaten before of any thing so
very delicious as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay, Marguerite, it is you that err. I
<span class='it'>know</span> that the meat of which you now partake,
is one which you have always found the sweetest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something now in the voice of the
speaker that made Marguerite look up. Her eyes
immediately met his own, and the wolfish exultation
which they betrayed confounded her and made
her shudder. She felt at once terrified with a
nameless fear. There was a sudden sickness and
sinking of her heart. She felt that there was a terrible
meaning, a dreadful mystery in his looks and
words, the solution of which she shrunk from with
a vague but absorbing terror. She was too well
acquainted with the sinister expression of that
glance. She rallied herself to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it that you mean, my lord? Something
dreadful! What have you done? This food—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, this food! I can very well understand that
you should find it delicious. It is such as you have
always loved a little too much. It is but natural
that you should relish, now that it is dead, that
which you so passionately enjoyed while living.
Marguerite, the meat of that dish which you have
eaten was once the heart of Guillaume de Cabestaign!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lips of the wretched woman parted spasmodically.
Her jaws seemed to stretch asunder.
Her eyes dilated in a horror akin to madness. Her
arms were stretched out and forward. She half
rose from the table, which she at length seized upon
for her support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she exclaimed, hoarsely, at length. “No!
no! It is not true. It is not possible. I will not—I
dare not believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have a witness, Marguerite! You
shall hear it from one whom, heretofore, you have
believed always, and who will find it impossible
now to lie. Behold! This is the head of him
whose heart you have eaten!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these dreadful words, the cruel baron raised
the ghastly head of the troubadour, which he had
hitherto concealed beneath the table, and which he
now placed upon it. At this horrible spectacle the
wretched woman sunk down in a swoon, from
which, however, she awakened but too quickly.
The wan and bloody aspect of her lover, the eyes
glazed in death, but full still of the tenderest expression,
met her gaze as it opened upon the light.
The savage lord who had achieved the horrid
butchery stood erect, and pointing at the spectacle
of terror. His scornful and demoniac glance—the
horrid cruelty of which he continued to boast—her
conscious innocence and that of her lover—her
complete and deep despair—all conspired to arm
her soul with a courage which she had never felt
till now. In the ruin of her heart she had grown
reckless of her life. Her eye confronted the murderer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so!” she exclaimed. “As I have eaten of
meat so precious, it fits not that inferior food should
ever again pass these lips! This is the last supper
which I shall taste on earth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! dare you thus shamelessly avow to me
your passion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay! as God who beholds us knows, never did
woman more passionately and truly love mortal
man, than did Marguerite of Roussillon the pure
and noble Guillaume de Cabestaign. It is true! I
fear not to say it now! Now, indeed, I am his only
and forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Transported with fury at what he heard, Raymond
drew his dagger, and rushed to where she
stood. But she did not await his weapon. Anticipating
his wrath, she darted headlong through a
door which opened upon a balcony, over the balustrade
of which, with a second effort, she flung herself
into the court below. All this was the work of
but one impulse and of a single instant Raymond
reached the balcony as the delicate frame of the
beautiful woman was crushed upon the flag-stones
of the court. Life had utterly departed when they
raised her from the ground!</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>This terrible catastrophe struck society every
where with consternation. At a season, when not
only chivalry, but the church, gave its most absolute
sanction to the existence and encouragement of
that strange conventional love which we have
sought to describe, the crime of Raymond provoked
an universal honor. Love, artificial and sentimental
rather than passionate, was the soul equally
of military achievement and of aristocratic society.
It was then of vast importance, as an element of
power, in the use of religious enthusiasm. The
shock given to those who cherished this sentiment,
by this dreadful history, was felt to all the extremities
of the social circle. The friends and kindred of
the lovers—the princes and princesses of the land—noble
lords, knights and ladies, all combined, as by
a common impulse, to denounce and to destroy the
bloody-minded criminal. Alphonso, King of Arragon,
devoted himself to the work of justice. Raymond
was seized and cast into a dungeon. His
castle was razed to the ground, under a public decree,
which scarcely anticipated the eager rage of
hundreds who rushed to the work of demolition.
The criminal himself was suffered to live; but he
lived either in prison or in exile, with loss of caste
and society, and amidst universal detestation!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very different was the fate of the lovers, whom
man could no more harm or separate. They were
honored, under the sanction of Alphonso, with a
gorgeous funeral procession. They were laid together,
in the same tomb, before the church of Perpignan,
and their names and cruel history were
duly engraven upon the stone raised to their
memory. According the Provençal historians, it was
afterward a custom with the knights of Roussillon,
of Cerdagne, and of Narbonnois, every year to join
with the noble dames and ladies of the same places,
in a solemn service, in memory of Marguerite of
Roussillon, and William of Cabestaign. At the
same time came lovers of both sexes, on a pilgrimage
to their tomb, where they prayed for the repose
of their souls. The anniversary of this service was
instituted by Alphonso. We may add that romance
has more than once seized upon this tragic history,
out of which to weave her fictions. Boccaccio has
found in it the material for one of the stories of the
Decameron, in which, however, while perverting
history, he has done but little to merit the gratulation
of Art. He has failed equally to do justice to
himself, and to his melancholy subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Spike</span> was sleeping hard in his berth, quite early
on the following morning, before the return of light,
indeed, when he suddenly started up, rubbed his
eyes, and sprang upon deck like a man alarmed.
He had heard, or fancied he had heard, a cry. A
voice once well known and listened to, seemed to
call him in the very portals of his ear. At first he
had listened to its words in wonder, entranced like
the bird by the snake, the tones recalling scenes and
persons that had once possessed a strong control
over his rude feelings. Presently the voice became
harsher in its utterance, and it said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stephen Spike, awake! The hour is getting late,
and you have enemies nearer to you than you
imagine. Awake, Stephen, awake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the captain was on his feet, and had
plunged his head into a basin of water that stood
ready for him in the state-room, he could not have
told, for his life, whether he had been dreaming or
waking, whether what he had heard was the result
of a feverish imagination, or of the laws of nature.
The call haunted him all that morning, or until
events of importance so pressed upon him as to
draw his undivided attention to them alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not yet day. The men were still in heavy
sleep, lying about the decks, for they avoided the
small and crowded forecastle in that warm climate,
and the night was apparently at its deepest hour.
Spike walked forward to look for the man charged
with the anchor-watch. It proved to be Jack Tier,
who was standing near the galley, his arms folded
as usual, apparently watching the few signs of approaching
day that were beginning to be apparent
in the western sky. The captain was in none of
the best humors with the steward’s assistant; but
Jack had unaccountably got an ascendency over
his commander, which it was certainly very unusual
for any subordinate in the Swash to obtain. Spike
had deferred more to Mulford than to any mate he
had ever before employed; but this was the deference
due to superior information, manners, and
origin. It was common-place, if not vulgar; whereas,
the ascendency obtained by little Jack Tier was,
even to its subject, entirely inexplicable. He was
unwilling to admit it to himself in the most secret
manner, though he had begun to feel it on all occasions
which brought them in contact, and to submit
to it as a thing not to be averted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack Tier,” demanded the captain, now that he
found himself once more alone with the other, desirous
of obtaining his opinion on a point that harrassed
him, though he knew not why; “Jack Tier,
answer me one thing. Do you believe that we saw
the form of a dead or of a living man at the foot of
the light-house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dead are never seen leaning against walls
in that manner, Stephen Spike,” answered Jack,
coolly, not even taking the trouble to uncoil his
arms. “What you saw was a living man; and
you would do well to be on your guard against him.
Harry Mulford is not your friend—and there is
reason for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry Mulford, and living! How can that be,
Jack? You know the port in which he chose to run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the rock on which you chose to abandon
him, Capt. Spike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If so, how could he be living and at the Dry
Tortugas? The thing is impossible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing is so. You saw Harry Mulford, living
and well, and ready to hunt you to the gallows.
Beware of him, then; and beware of his handsome
wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wife! the fellow has no wife—he has always
professed to be a single man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man is married—and I bid you beware of
his handsome wife. She, too, will be a witness
ag’in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will be news, then, for Rose Budd. I shall
delight in telling it to <span class='it'>her</span>, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twill be <span class='it'>no</span> news to Rose Budd. She was present
at the wedding, and will not be taken by surprise.
Rose loves Harry too well to let him marry,
and she not present at the wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack, you talk strangely! What is the meaning
of all this? I am captain of this craft, and will not
be trifled with—tell me at once your meaning,
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My meaning is simple enough, and easily told.
Rose Budd is the wife of Harry Mulford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re dreaming, fellow, or are wishing to trifle
with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be a dream, but it is one that will turn
out to be true. If they have found the Poughkeepsie
sloop-of-war, as I make no doubt they have by this
time, Mulford and Rose are man and wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool! you know not what you say! Rose is at
this moment in her berth, sick at heart on account
of the young gentleman who preferred to live on the
Florida Reef rather than to sail in the Molly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rose is not in her berth, sick or well; neither is
she on board this brig at all. She went off in the
light-house boat to deliver her lover from the naked
rock—and well did she succeed in so doing. God
was of her side, Stephen Spike; and a body seldom
foils with such a friend to support one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike was astounded at these words, and not less
so at the cool and confident manner with which
they were pronounced. Jack spoke in a certain
dogmatical, oracular manner, it is true, one that
might have lessened his authority with a person
over whom he had less influence; but this in no degree
diminished its effect on Spike. On the contrary,
it even disposed the captain to yield an implicit
faith to what he heard, and all so much the
more because the facts he was told appeared of
themselves to be nearly impossible. It was half a
minute before he had sufficiently recovered from his
surprise to continue the discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The light-house boat!” Spike then slowly repeated.
“Why, fellow, you told me the light-house
boat went adrift from your own hands!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it did,” answered Jack, coolly, “since I cast
off the painter—and what is more, went in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You! This is impossible. You are telling me a
fabricated lie. If you had gone away in that boat,
how could you now be here? No, no—it is a miserable
lie, and Rose is below!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and look into her state-room, and satisfy yourself
with your own eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike did as was suggested. He went below,
took a lamp that was always suspended, lighted, in
the main cabin, and, without ceremony, proceeded
to Rose’s state-room, where he soon found that the
bird had really flown. A direful execration followed
this discovery, one so loud as to awaken Mrs. Budd
and Biddy. Determined not to do things by halves,
he broke open the door of the widow’s state-room,
and ascertained that the person he sought was not
there. A fierce explosion of oaths and denunciations
followed, which produced an answer in the customary
screams. In the midst of this violent scene,
however, questions were put, and answers obtained,
that not only served to let the captain know that
Jack had told him nothing but truth, but to put an
end to every thing like amicable relations between
himself and the relict of his old commander. Until
this explosion, appearances had been observed between
them; but, from that moment, there must
necessarily be an end of all professions of even
civility. Spike was never particularly refined in his
intercourse with females, but he now threw aside
even its pretension. His rage was so great that he
totally forgot his manhood, and lavished on both Mrs.
Budd and Biddy epithets that were altogether inexcusable,
and many of which it will not do to repeat.
Weak and silly as was the widow, she was not
without spirit; and on this occasion she was indisposed
to submit to all this unmerited abuse in silence.
Biddy, as usual, took her cue from her mistress, and
between the two, their part of the wordy conflict
was kept up with a very respectable degree of
animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you—I know you, now!” screamed the
widow, at the top of her voice; “and you can no
longer deceive me, unworthy son of Neptune as
you are! You are unfit to be a lubber, and would
be log-booked for an or’nary by every gentleman on
board ship. You, a full-jiggered seaman! No, you
are not even half-jiggered, sir; and I tell you so to
your face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and it isn’t <span class='it'>half</span> that might be tould the likes
of yees!” put in Biddy, as her mistress stopped to
breathe. “And it’s Miss Rose you’d have for a
wife, when Biddy Noon would be too good for ye!
We knows ye, and all about ye, and can give yer
history as complate from the day ye was born down
to the present moment, and not find a good word to
say in yer favor in all that time—and a precious time
it is, too, for a gentleman that would marry pretthy,
<span class='it'>young</span> Miss Rose! Och! I scorn to look at ye, yer
so ugly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And trying to persuade me you were a friend
of my poor, dear Mr. Budd, whose shoe you are unworthy
to touch, and who had the heart and soul for
the noble profession you disgrace,” cut in the widow,
the moment Biddy gave her a chance, by pausing
to make a wry face as she pronounced the word
“ugly.” “I now believe you capasided them poor
Mexicans, in order to get their money; and the moment
we cast anchor in a road-side, I’ll go ashore,
and complain of you for murder, I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do, missus, dear, and I’ll be your bail, will I,
and swear to all that happened, and more too. Och!
yer a wretch, to wish to be the husband of Miss
Rose, and she so young and pretthy, and you so
ould and ugly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come away—come away, Stephen Spike, and
do not stand wrangling with women, when you and
your brig, and all that belongs to you are in danger,”
called out Jack Tier from the companion-way. “Day
is come; and what is much worse for you, your
most dangerous enemy is coming with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike was almost livid with rage, and ready to
burst out in awful maledictions; but at this summons
he sprang to the ladder, and was on deck in
a moment. At first, he felt a strong disposition to
wreak his vengeance on Tier, but, fortunately for
the latter, as the captain’s foot touched the quarter-deck,
his eye fell on the Poughkeepsie, then within
half a league of the Swash, standing in toward the
reef, though fully half a mile to leeward. This
spectre drove all other subjects from his mind, leaving
the captain of the Swash in the only character in
which he could be said to be respectable, or that of a
seaman. Almost instinctively he called all hands,
then he gave one brief minute to a survey of his
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, indeed, time for the Swash to be moving.
There she lay, with three anchors down, including
that of the schooner, all she had, in fact, with the
exception of her best bower, and one kedge, with
the purchases aloft, in readiness for hooking on to
the wreck, and all the extra securities up that had
been given to the masts. As for the sloop-of-war,
she was under the very same canvas as that with
which she had come out from the Dry Tortugas, or
her three top-sails, spanker, and jib; but most of her
other sails were loose, even to her royals and flying-jibs,
though closely gathered into their spars by
means of the running gear. In a word, every sailor
would know, at a glance, that the ship was merely
waiting for the proper moment to spread her wings,
when she would be flying through the water at the
top of her speed. The weather looked dirty, and the
wind was gradually increasing, threatening to blow
heavily as the day advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unshackle, unshackle!” shouted Spike to the
boatswain, who was the first man that appeared on
deck. “The bloody sloop-of-war is upon us, and
there is not a moment to lose. We must get the
brig clear of the ground in the shortest way we can,
and abandon every thing. Unshackle, and cast off
for’ard and aft, men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes of almost desperate exertion succeeded.
No men work like sailors, when the last
are in a hurry, their efforts being directed to counteracting
squalls, and avoiding emergencies of the
most pressing character. Thus was it now with
the crew of the Swash. The clanking of chains
lasted but a minute, when the parts attached to the
anchors were thrust through the hawse-holes, or
were dropped into the water from other parts of the
brig. This at once released the vessel, though a
great deal remained to be done to clear her for
working, and to put her in her best trim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away with this out-hauler!” again shouted Spike,
casting loose the main-brails as he did so; “loose
the jibs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went on at once, and the Swash moved away
from the grave of the poor carpenter with the ease
and facility of motion that marked all her evolutions.
Then the top-sail was let fall, and presently all the
upper square-sails were sheeted home, and hoisted,
and the fore-tack was hauled aboard. The Molly
was soon alive, and jumping into the seas that met
her with more power than was common, as she
drew out from under the shelter of the reef into
rough water. From the time when Spike gave his
first order, to that when all his canvas was spread,
was just seven minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Poughkeepsie, with her vastly superior crew,
was not idle the while. Although the watch below
was not disturbed, she tacked beautifully, and stood
off the reef, in a line parallel to the course of the
brig, and distant from her about half a mile. Then
sail was made, her tacks having been boarded in
stays. Spike knew the play of his craft was short
legs, for she was so nimble in her movements that he
believed she could go about in half the time that
would be required for a vessel of the Poughkeepsie’s
length. “Ready about,” was his cry, therefore,
when less than a mile distant from the reef—“ready
about, and let her go round.” Round the Molly did
go, like a top, being full on the other tack in just
fifty-six seconds. The movement of the corvette
was more stately, and somewhat more deliberate.
Still, she stayed beautifully, and both Spike and the
boatswain shook their heads, as they saw her
coming into the wind with her sails all lifting and
the sheets flowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow will fore-reach a cable’s length before
he gets about!” exclaimed Spike. “He will
prove too much for us at this sport! Keep her
away, my man—keep the brig away for the passage.
We must run through the reef, instead of trusting
ourselves to our heels in open water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brig was kept away accordingly, and sheets
were eased off, and braces just touched, to meet the
new line of sailing. As the wind stood, it was possible
to lay through the passage on an easy bowline,
though the breeze, which was getting to be fresher
than Spike wished it to be, promised to haul more
to the southward of east, as the day advanced.
Nevertheless, this was the Swash’s best point of
sailing, and all on board of her had strong hopes of
her being too much for her pursuer, could she maintain
it. Until this feeling began to diffuse itself in
the brig, not a countenance was to be seen on her
decks that did not betray intense anxiety; but now
something like grim smiles passed among the crew,
as their craft seemed rather to fly than force her
way through the water, toward the entrance of the
passage so often adverted to in this narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the Poughkeepsie was admirably
sailed and handled. Everybody was now on
deck, and the first lieutenant had taken the trumpet.
Capt. Mull was a man of method, and a thorough
man-of-war’s man. Whatever he did was done
according to rule, and with great system. Just as
the Swash was about to enter the passage, the drum
of the Poughkeepsie beat to quarters. No sooner
were the men mustered, in the leeward, or starboard
batteries, than orders were sent to cast loose
the guns, and to get them ready for service. Owing
to the more leeward position of his vessel, and to
the fact that she always head-reached so much in
stays, Capt. Mull knew that she would not lose
much by luffing into the wind, or by making half
boards, while he might gain every thing by one
well directed shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strife commenced by the sloop-of-war firing
her weather bow-gun, single-shotted, at the Swash.
No damage was done, though the fore-yard of the
brig had a very narrow escape. This experiment
was repeated three times, without even a rope-yarn
being carried away, though the gun was pointed by
Wallace himself and well pointed, too. But it is
possible for a shot to come very near its object and
still to do no injury. Such was the fact on this
occasion, though the “ship’s gentleman” was a good
deal mortified by the result. Men look so much at
success as the test of merit, that few pause to inquire
into the reasons of failures, though it frequently
happens that adventurers prosper by means of their
very blunders. Capt. Mull now determined on a
half board, for his ship was more to leeward than
he desired. Directions were given to the officers in
the batteries to be deliberate, and the helm was put
down. As the ship shot into the wind, each gun
was fired, as it could be brought to bear, until the
last of them all was discharged. Then the course
of the vessel was changed, the helm being righted
before the ship had lost her way, and the sloop-of-war
fell off again to her course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was done in such a short period of time
as scarcely to cause the Poughkeepsie to lose any
thing, while it did the Swash the most serious injury.
The guns had been directed at the brig’s
spars and sails, Capt. Mull desiring no more than to
capture his chase, and the destruction they produced
aloft was such as to induce Spike and
his men, at first, to imagine that the whole hamper
above their heads was about to come clattering
down on deck. One shot carried away all the
weather fore-topmast rigging of the brig, and would
no doubt have brought about the loss of the
mast, if another, that almost instantly succeeded it
had not cut the spar itself in two, bringing down, as
a matter of course, every thing above it. Nearly
half of the main-mast was gouged out of that spar,
and the gaff was taken fairly out of its jaws. The
fore-yard was cut in the slings, and various important
ropes, were carried away in different parts of
the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flight under such circumstances, was impossible,
unless some extraordinary external assistance was
to be obtained. This Spike saw at once, and he
had recourse to the only expedient that remained;
which might possibly yet save him. The guns
were still belching forth their smoke and flames,
when he shouted out the order to put the helm hard
up. The width of the passage in which the vessels
were was not so great but that he might hope to
pass across it and to enter a channel among the
rocks, which was favorably placed for such a purpose,
ere the sloop-of-war could overtake him.
Whither that channel led, what water it possessed,
or whether it were not a shallow <span class='it'>cul de sac</span>, were
all facts of which Spike was ignorant. The circumstances,
however, would not admit of an alternative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily for the execution of Spike’s present design,
nothing from aloft had fallen into the water, to
impede the brig’s way. Forward, in particular, she
seemed all wreck; her fore-yard having come
down altogether, so as to encumber the forecastle,
while her top-mast, with its dependent spars and
gear, was suspended but a short distance above.
Still, nothing had gone over the side, so as actually
to touch the water, and the craft obeyed her helm
as usual. Away she went, then, for the lateral
opening in the reef just mentioned, driven ahead by
the pressure of a strong breeze on her sails, which
still offered large surfaces to the wind, at a rapid
rate. Instead of keeping away to follow, the Poughkeepsie
maintained her luff, and just as the Swash
entered the unknown passage, into which she was
blindly plunging, the sloop-of war was about a quarter
of a mile to windward, and standing directly
across her stern. Nothing would have been easier,
now, than for Capt. Mull to destroy his chase; but
humanity prevented his firing. He knew that her
career must be short, and he fully expected to
see her anchor; when it would be easy for him
to take possession with his boats. With this expectation,
indeed, he shortened sail, furling top-gallant-sails,
and hauling up his courses. By this
time, the wind had so much freshened, as to induce
him to think of putting in a reef, and the step now
taken had a double object in view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the surprise of all on board the man-of-war,
the brig continued on, until she was fully a mile
distant, finding her way deeper and deeper among
the mazes of the reef without meeting with any impediment!
This fact induced Capt. Mull to order
his Paixhan’s to throw their shells beyond her, by
way of a hint to anchor. While the guns were getting
ready, Spike stood on boldly, knowing it was
neck or nothing, and beginning to feel a faint revival
of hope, as he found himself getting further and
further from his pursuers, and the rocks not fetching
him up. Even the men, who had begun to murmur
at what seemed to them to be risking too much,
partook, in a slight degree, of the same feeling, and
began to execute the order they had received to
try to get the launch into the water, with some appearance
of an intention to succeed. Previously,
the work could scarcely be said to go on at all; but
two or three of the older seamen now bestirred
themselves, and suggestions were made and attended
to, that promised results. But it was no
easy thing to get the launch out of a half-rigged
brig, that had lost her fore-yard, and which carried
nothing square abaft. A derrick was used in common,
to lift the stern of the boat, but a derrick would
now be useless aft, without an assistant forward.
While these things were in discussion, under the
superintendence of the boatswain, and Spike was
standing between the knight-heads, conning the
craft, the sloop-of-war let fly the first of her hollow
shot. Down came the hurtling mass upon the
Swash, keeping every head elevated and all eyes
looking for the dark object, as it went booming
through the air above their heads. The shot passed
fully a mile to leeward, where it exploded. This
great range had been given to the first shot, with a
view to admonish the captain how long he must
continue under the guns of the ship, and as advice
to come to. The second gun followed immediately.
Its shot was seen to ricochet, directly in a line with
the brig, making leaps of about half a mile in length.
It struck the water about fifty yards astern of the
vessel, bounded directly over her decks, passing
through the main-sail and some of the fallen hamper
forward, and exploded about a hundred yards
ahead. As usually happens with such projectiles,
most of the fragments were either scattered laterally,
or went on, impelled by the original momentum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect of this last gun on the crew of the
Swash was instantaneous and deep. The faint
gleamings of hope vanished at once, and a lively
consciousness of the desperate nature of their condition
succeeded in every mind. The launch was
forgotten, and, after conferring together for a moment,
the men went in a body, with the boatswain
at their head, to the forecastle, and offered a remonstrance
to their commander, on the subject of
holding out any longer, under circumstances so
very hazardous, and which menaced their lives in
so many different ways. Spike listened to them
with eyes that fairly glared with fury. He ordered
them back to their duty in a voice of thunder, tapping
the breast of his jacket, where he was known
to carry revolvers, with a significance that could
convey but one meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is wonderful the ascendency that men sometimes
obtain over their fellows, by means of character,
the habits of command, and obedience, and intimidation.
Spike was a stern disciplinarian, relying
on that and ample pay for the unlimited control
he often found it necessary to exercise over his
crew. On the present occasion, his people were
profoundly alarmed, but habitual deference and submission
to their leader counteracted the feeling, and
held them in suspense. They were fully aware of
the nature of the position they occupied in a legal
sense, and were deeply reluctant to increase the
appearances of crime; but most of them had been
extricated from so many grave difficulties in former
instances, by the coolness, nerve and readiness of
the captain, that a latent ray of hope was perhaps
dimly shining in the rude breast of every old sea-dog
among them. As a consequence of these
several causes, they abandoned their remonstrance,
for the moment at least, and made a show of returning
to their duty; though it was in a sullen and
moody manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was easier, however, to make a show of hoisting
out the launch, than to effect the object. This
was soon made apparent on trial, and Spike himself
gave the matter up. He ordered the yawl to be
lowered, got alongside, and to be prepared for the
reception of the crew, by putting into it a small provision
of food and water. All this time the brig
was rushing madly to leeward, among rocks and
breakers, without any other guide than that which
the visible dangers afforded. Spike knew no more
where he was going than the meanest man in his
vessel. His sole aim was to get away from his pursuers,
and to save his neck from the rope. He magnified
the danger of punishment that he really ran,
for he best knew the extent and nature of his crimes,
of which the few that have been laid before the
reader, while they might have been amongst the
most prominent, as viewed through the statutes and
international law, were far from the gravest he had
committed in the eyes of morals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time the Señor Montefalderon went
forward to confer with Spike. The calmness of this
gentleman’s demeanor, the simplicity and coolness
of his movements, denoted a conscience that saw
no particular ground for alarm. He wished to
escape captivity, that he might continue to serve
his country, but no other apprehension troubled
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you intend to trust yourself in the yawl, Don
Esteban?” demanded the Mexican quietly. “If so,
is she not too small to contain so many as we shall
make altogether?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike’s answer was given in a low voice; and it
evidently came from a very husky throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak lower, Don Wan,” he said. “The boat
would be greatly overloaded with all hands in it,
especially among the breakers, and blowing as it
does; but we may leave some of the party behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The brig <span class='it'>must</span> go on the rocks, sooner or later,
Don Esteban; when she does, she will go to pieces
in an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect to hear her strike every minute, señor;
the moment she does we must be off. I have had
my eye on that ship for some time, expecting to see
her lower her cutters and gigs to board us. <span class='it'>You</span>
will not be out of the way, Don Wan; but there is
no need of being talkative on the subject of our
escape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spike now turned his back on the Mexican,
looking anxiously ahead, with the desire to get as
far into the reef as possible with his brig, which he
conned with great skill and coolness. The Señor
Montefalderon left him. With the chivalry and
consideration of a man and a gentleman, he went
in quest of Mrs. Budd and Biddy. A hint sufficed
for them, and gathering together a few necessaries
they were in the yawl in the next three minutes.
This movement was unseen by Spike, or he might
have prevented, it. His eyes were now riveted on
the channel ahead. It had been fully his original
intention to make off in the boat, the instant the
brig struck, abandoning not only Don Juan, with
Mrs. Budd and Biddy to their fates, but most of the
crew. A private order had been given to the boatswain,
and three of the ablest bodied among the
seamen, each and all of whom kept the secret with
religious fidelity, as it was believed their own personal
safety might be connected with the success of
this plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing is so contagious as alarm. It requires
not only great natural steadiness of nerve, but
much acquired firmness to remain unmoved when
sudden terror has seized on the minds of those
around us. Habitual respect had prevented the
crew from interfering with the movements of the
Mexican, who not only descended into the boat
with his female companions uninterrupted, but also
took with him the little bag of doubloons which
fell to his share from the first raising of the schooner.
Josh and Jack Tier assisted in getting Mrs. Budd
and Biddy over the side, and both took their own
places in the yawl, as soon as this pious duty was
discharged. This served as a hint to others near at
hand; and man after man left his work to steal into
the yawl, until every living being had disappeared
from the deck of the Swash, Spike himself excepted.
The man at the wheel had been the last to desert
his post, nor would he have done so then, but for a
signal from the boatswain, with whom he was a
favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is certain there was a secret desire among the
people of the Swash, who were now crowded into
a boat not large enough to contain more than half
their number with safety, to push off from the
brig’s side, and abandon her commander and
owner to his fate. All had passed so soon, however,
and events succeeded each other with so
much rapidity, that little time was given for consultation.
Habit kept them in their places, though
the appearances around them were strong motives
for taking care of themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding the time necessary to relate the
foregoing events, a quarter of an hour had not
elapsed, from the moment when the Swash entered
this unknown channel among the rocks, ere she
struck. No sooner was her helm deserted than
she broached-to, and Spike was in the act of denouncing
the steerage, ignorant of its cause, when
the brig was thrown, broadside-to, on a sharp,
angular bed of rocks. It was fortunate for the boat,
and all in it, that it was brought to leeward by the
broaching-to of the vessel, and that the water was
still sufficiently deep around them to prevent the
waves from breaking. Breakers there were, however,
in thousands, on every side; and the seamen
understood that their situation was almost desperately
perilous, without shipwreck coming to increase
the danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm itself was scarcely more noisy and
boisterous than was Spike, when he ascertained
the manner in which his people had behaved. At
first, he believed it was their plan to abandon him
to his fate; but, on rushing to the lee-gangway, Don
Juan Montefalderon assured him that no such intention
existed, and that he would not allow the boat
to be cast off until the captain was received on
board. This brief respite gave Spike a moment to
care for his portion of the doubloons; and he rushed
to his state-room to secure them, together with his
quadrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grinding of the brig’s bottom on the coral,
announced a speedy breaking up of the craft,
while her commander was thus employed. So
violent were some of the shocks with which she
came down on the hard bed in which she was now
cradled, that Spike expected to see her burst asunder,
while he was yet on her decks. The cracking
of timbers told him that all was over with the Swash,
nor had he got back as far as the gangway with his
prize, before he saw plainly that the vessel had broken
her back, as it is termed, and that her plank-sheer
was opening in a way that threatened to permit a
separation of the craft into two sections, one forward
and the other aft. Notwithstanding all these
portentous proofs that the minutes of the Molly
were numbered, and the danger that existed of his
being abandoned by his crew, Spike paused a moment,
ere he went over the vessel’s side, to take a
hasty survey of the reef. His object was to get a
general idea of the position of the breakers, with a
view to avoid them. As much of the interest of
that which is to succeed is connected with these
particular dangers, it may be well to explain their
character, along with a few other points of a similar
bearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brig had gone ashore fully two miles within
the passage she had entered, and which, indeed,
terminated at the very spot where she had struck.
The Poughkeepsie was standing off and on, in the
main channel, with her boats in the water, evidently
preparing to carry the brig in that mode. As for
the breakers, they whitened the surface of the ocean
in all directions around the wreck, far as the eye
could reach, but in two. The passage in which the
Poughkeepsie was standing to and fro was clear of
them, of course; and about a mile and a half to the
northward, Spike saw that he should be in open
water, or altogether on the northern side of the reef,
could he only get there. The gravest dangers
would exist in the passage, which led among
breakers on all sides, and very possibly among
rocks so near the surface as to absolutely obstruct
the way. In one sense, however, the breakers
were useful. By avoiding them as much as possible,
and by keeping in the unbroken water, the
boat would be running in the channels of the reef,
and consequently would be the safer. The result
of the survey, short as it was, and it did not last a
minute, was to give Spike something like a plan;
and when he went over the side, and got into the
boat, it was with a determination to work his way
out of the reef to its northern edge, as soon as
possible, and then to skirt it as near as he could, in
his flight toward the Dry Tortugas.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The hand of the operator wavered—the</p>
<p class='line0'>instrument glanced aside—in a moment she</p>
<p class='line0'>was blind for life. MS.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Blind, said you? Blind for life!</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis but a jest—no, no, it cannot be</p>
<p class='line0'>That I no more the blessed light may see!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Oh, what a fearful strife</p>
<p class='line0'>Of horrid thought is raging in my mind.</p>
<p class='line0'>I did not hear aright—“forever blind!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mother, you would not speak</p>
<p class='line0'>Aught but the truth to me, your stricken child;</p>
<p class='line0'>Tell me I do but dream; my brain is wild,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And yet my heart is weak.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, mother, fold me in a close embrace,</p>
<p class='line0'>Bend down to me that dear, that gentle face.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I cannot hear your voice!</p>
<p class='line0'>Speak louder, mother. Speak to me, and say</p>
<p class='line0'>This frightful dream will quickly pass away.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Have I no hope, no choice?</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, Heaven, with light, has sound, too, from me fled!</p>
<p class='line0'>Call, shout aloud, as if to wake the dead.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thank God! I hear you now.</p>
<p class='line0'>I hear the beating of your troubled heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>With every wo of mine it has a part;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Upon my upturned brow</p>
<p class='line0'>The hot tears fall, from those dear eyes, for me.</p>
<p class='line0'>Once more, oh is it true I may not see?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This silence chills my blood.</p>
<p class='line0'>Had you one word of comfort, all my fears</p>
<p class='line0'>Were quickly banished—faster still the tears,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A bitter, burning flood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fall on my face, and now one trembling word</p>
<p class='line0'>Confirms the dreadful truth my ears have heard.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Why weep you? I am calm.</p>
<p class='line0'>My wan lip quivers not, my heart is still.</p>
<p class='line0'>My swollen temples—see, they do not thrill!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That word was as a charm.</p>
<p class='line0'>Tell me the worst, all, all I now can bear.</p>
<p class='line0'>I have a fearful strength—that of despair.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;What is it to be blind?</p>
<p class='line0'>To be shut out forever, from the skies—</p>
<p class='line0'>To see no more the “light of loving eyes”—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And, as years pass, to find</p>
<p class='line0'>My lot unvaried by one passing gleam</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the bright woodland, or the flashing stream!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To feel the breath of Spring,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet not to view one of the tiny flowers</p>
<p class='line0'>That come from out the earth with her soft showers;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To hear the bright birds sing,</p>
<p class='line0'>And feel, while listening to their joyous strain,</p>
<p class='line0'>My heart can ne’er know happiness again!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then in the solemn night</p>
<p class='line0'>To lie alone, while all anear me sleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And fancy fearful forms about me creep.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Starting in wild afright,</p>
<p class='line0'>To know, if true, I could not have the power</p>
<p class='line0'>To ward off danger in that lonely hour.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And as my breath came thick</p>
<p class='line0'>To feel the hideous darkness round me press,</p>
<p class='line0'>Adding new terror to my loneliness;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;While every pulse leapt quick</p>
<p class='line0'>To clutch and grasp at the black, stifling air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then sink in stupor from my wild despair.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It comes upon me now!</p>
<p class='line0'>I cannot breathe, my heart grows sick and chill,</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh, mother, are your arms about me still—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Still o’er me do you bow?</p>
<p class='line0'>And yet I care not, better all alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>No one to heed my weakness should I moan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Again! I will not live.</p>
<p class='line0'>Death is no worse than this eternal night—</p>
<p class='line0'>Those resting in the grave heed not the light!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Small comfort can ye give.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes, Death is welcome as my only friend</p>
<p class='line0'>In the calm grave my sorrows will have end.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Talk not to me of hope!</p>
<p class='line0'>Have you not told me it is all in vain—</p>
<p class='line0'>That while I live I may not see again?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That earth, and the broad scope</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the blue heaven—that all things glad and free</p>
<p class='line0'>Henceforth are hidden—tell of hope to me?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It is not hard to lie</p>
<p class='line0'>Calmly, and silently in that long sleep;</p>
<p class='line0'>No fear can wake me from that slumber deep.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;So, mother—let me die;</p>
<p class='line0'>I shall be happier in the gentle rest</p>
<p class='line0'>Than living with this grief to fill my breast.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Thank God, that yet I live.</p>
<p class='line0'>In tender mercy, heeding not the prayer</p>
<p class='line0'>I boldly uttered, in my first despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He would not rashly give</p>
<p class='line0'>The punishment an erring spirit braved.</p>
<p class='line0'>From sudden death, in kindness. I was saved.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It was a fearful thought</p>
<p class='line0'>That this fair earth had not one pleasure left.</p>
<p class='line0'>I was at once of sight and hope bereft.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My soul was not yet taught</p>
<p class='line0'>To bow submissive to the sudden stroke;</p>
<p class='line0'>Its crushing weight my heart had well nigh broke.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Words are not that can tell</p>
<p class='line0'>The horrid thoughts that burned upon my brain—</p>
<p class='line0'>That came and went with madness still the same—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A black and icy spell</p>
<p class='line0'>That froze my life blood, stopped my fluttering breath,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was laid upon me—even “<span class='it'>life in death</span>.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Long weary months crept by,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I refused all comfort, turned aside</p>
<p class='line0'>Wishing that in my weakness I had died.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I uttered no reply,</p>
<p class='line0'>But without ceasing wept, and moaned, and prayed</p>
<p class='line0'>The hand of death no longer might be stayed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I shunned the gaze of all.</p>
<p class='line0'>I knew that pity dwelt in every look.</p>
<p class='line0'>Pity e’en then my proud breast could not brook,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Though darkness as a pall</p>
<p class='line0'>Circled me round, each mournful eye <span class='it'>I felt</span></p>
<p class='line0'>That for a moment on my features dwelt.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;You, dearest mother, know</p>
<p class='line0'>I shrank in sullenness from your caress.</p>
<p class='line0'>Even <span class='it'>your</span> kisses added to distress,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For burning tears would flow</p>
<p class='line0'>As you bent o’er me, whispering “be calm,</p>
<p class='line0'>He who hath wounded holds for thee a balm.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He did not seem a friend.</p>
<p class='line0'>I deemed in wrath the sudden blow was sent</p>
<p class='line0'>From a strong arm that never might relent.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That pain alone would end</p>
<p class='line0'>With life, for, mother, then it seemed to me</p>
<p class='line0'>That long, and dreamless, would death’s slumber be.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That blessed illness came.</p>
<p class='line0'>My weakened pulse now bounded wild and strong,</p>
<p class='line0'>While soon a raging fever burned along</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My worn, exhausted frame.</p>
<p class='line0'>And for the time all knowledge passed away.</p>
<p class='line0'>It mattered not that hidden was the day.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The odor of sweet flowers</p>
<p class='line0'>Came stealing through the casement when I woke;</p>
<p class='line0'>When the wild fever spell at last was broke.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And yet for many hours</p>
<p class='line0'>I laid in dreamy stillness, till your tone</p>
<p class='line0'>Called back the life that seemed forever flown.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;You, mother, knelt in prayer.</p>
<p class='line0'>While one dear hand was resting on my head,</p>
<p class='line0'>With sobbing voice, how fervently you plead</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For a strong heart, to bear</p>
<p class='line0'>The parting which you feared—“Or, if she live,</p>
<p class='line0'>Comfort, oh, Father! to the stricken give.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Take from her wandering mind</p>
<p class='line0'>The heavy load which it so long hath borne,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which even unto death her frame hath worn.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Let her in mercy find</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>That though the Earth she may no longer see,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Her spirit still can look to Heaven and Thee</span>.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A low sob from me stole.</p>
<p class='line0'>A moment more—your arms about me wound—</p>
<p class='line0'>My head upon your breast a pillow found.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And through my weary soul</p>
<p class='line0'>A holy calm came stealing from on high.</p>
<p class='line0'>Your prayer was answered—I was not to die.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then when the bell’s faint chime</p>
<p class='line0'>Came floating gently on the burdened air,</p>
<p class='line0'>My heart went up to God in fervent prayer.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And, mother, from that time</p>
<p class='line0'>My wild thoughts left me—hope returned once more—</p>
<p class='line0'>I felt that happiness was yet in store.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Daily new strength was given.</p>
<p class='line0'>For the first time, since darkness on me fell,</p>
<p class='line0'>I passed with more of joy than words can tell</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Under the free blue Heaven.</p>
<p class='line0'>I bathed my brow in the cool gushing spring—</p>
<p class='line0'>How much of life those bright drops seemed to bring.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I crushed the dewy leaves</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the pale violets, and drank their breath—</p>
<p class='line0'>Though I had heard that at each floweret’s death</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A sister blossom grieves.</p>
<p class='line0'>I did not care to see their glorious hues,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fearing the richer <span class='it'>perfume</span> I might <a id='lose'></a>lose.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then in the dim old wood</p>
<p class='line0'>I laid me down beneath a bending tree,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dreamed, dear mother, waking dreams of thee.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I thought how just and good</p>
<p class='line0'>The power that had so gently sealed mine eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet bade new pleasures and new hopes arise.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For now in truth I find</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='sc'>My Father</span> all his promises hath kept;</p>
<p class='line0'>He comforts those who here in sadness wept.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Eyes to the blind”</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou art, oh, God! Earth I no longer see,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet trustfully my spirit looks to thee.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY G. LEE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Escaped</span> from the heat and noise of the city, I
went, a few years ago, some fifty miles into the
country, to spend a short time with a friend, who
lived in a pleasant village, the quiet air of which
had never been disturbed by rushing steamboat or
rumbling car. There was to me a Sabbath stillness
about the place that made the brief time I sojourned
in Heathdale a period of rest to my spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scenery around the village was rather picturesque
than bold. There were high hills, but no
mountains; deep valleys, but no abrupt precipices.
Far away along the distant horizon lay heavy blue
masses, like clouds; but, though their shapes looked
fantastic, they never changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend was a physician, and his practice lay
for miles around the village of Heathdale. In order
to have the pleasure of his society, as well as to
enjoy the beautiful scenery, I usually went with him
in all his country visits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning he said to me, “I shall have rather
a longer ride than usual to-day; but as it will be
through some of the finest scenery we have, you
must be my companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not hesitate. Recreation of mind and body
was my object in visiting the country, and in no
better way could I find both. So, when the doctor’s
light carriage drove up, I was ready to step into it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In talking of the past, the present, and the future,
as well as in remarking upon the various objects of
interest around us, we spent an hour, by which
time we were riding along an old, grass-covered
road, winding in many a graceful sweep, and lined
by tall poplars that had seen their palmiest days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wealth and taste have left their marks here,” I
said, as a fine old mansion, situated upon a gentle
eminence, came in sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the doctor, “both have been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are hardly present now, I should think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. They disappeared long since. Ten years
ago a lovelier spot than this could hardly have been
found; nor one in which were happier hearts. But
now the hearth is desolate. ‘The bright fire
quenched and gone.’ I never like to come here.
Of the many who lived and loved in this sweet
spot one only remains shivering by the darkened
fireside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor appeared to be disturbed. He was
silent for some moments, during which time my
eyes were marking all that was peculiar about the
place. The house that we were approaching was
a large, square-built, two-story edifice, with a portico,
and handsome Corinthian columns in front. It stood,
as just said, upon an eminence, one slope of which
was in a beautiful green lawn, and the others
terraced for gardens and shrubbery. Of the gardens,
only the plan remained; and rank weeds grew
where once had blossomed the sweetest flowers.
The untrimmed shrubbery as strongly attested, by
its wildness, tangled and irregular growth, the want
of care and culture. Everywhere that my eye
turned, I could see that the hand of taste had been—but
not of late. The summer-house was in ruins;
the fish-pond grown over with weeds; the statues
that stood here and there, broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom did this, or does this place belong?”
I asked, rousing by my question the doctor from the
musing mood into which he had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To an English gentleman of fortune, taste, and
intelligence, named Belmont,” he replied. “When
a young man, he came to the United States for the
purpose of seeing the country, with ample means
and freedom from business. He lingered wherever
he went as long as pleased his fancy. Something
drew him to this part of our state, where he spent
two or three months. In his rambles about he fell
upon this spot, which had been cleared by a farmer,
whose log-cabin stood upon the very site of that fine
old mansion. Struck with its natural beauty, Belmont
made the man a liberal offer for his farm,
which was accepted. A year afterward he returned
and commenced and completed as rapidly as possible,
all the main improvements you now see. But,
as we are at the door, I must defer this narrative
until I have seen my patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor then left me in the carriage while he
went into the house. He was gone nearly half an
hour. When he returned he looked graver than
when he went in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It always gives me the heart-ache to visit here,”
he said, as we rode away. “<span class='it'>My</span> medicine can do
no good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your patient has a disease of the mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, an incurable one,” he replied. “<a id='hers'></a>Hers is a
heart-sickness beyond my skill to heal. She needs
a spiritual rather than a bodily physician. But to
resume where I left off. Mr. Belmont was occupied
about two years in building that handsome house,
and in improving these grounds. A part of his time
was spent in superintending these improvements
in person; but the greater portion of it was passed
in England. When all was completed, the house
was elegantly furnished, and Mr. Belmont, with a
lovely bride, retired from the world, to live here in
beautiful seclusion. People wondered why a young
couple, who had evidently mingled in the gayest
circles, and been used to elegant and refined society,
should hide themselves, as it were, in the vicinity
of a small village in Pennsylvania, thousands of
miles away from their old homes and country.
For a while there was a great deal of gossip on the
subject, and dozens of little stories afloat as to what
this, that, or the other servant at the ‘white house’
had said about the young wife of Belmont. It was
alledged that she was often seen weeping, and that
she was not at all happy. This, however, was not
generally believed; for Mrs. Belmont was seen
every Sabbath at the village church, and looked so
cheerful, and leaned so lovingly toward her husband,
that all idea of her being unhappy was banished
from the mind. Still, people continued to wonder
why a young and wealthy Englishman, of noble
blood, for aught they knew, should prefer the deep
seclusion of an almost forest-life in America. Subsequent
events threw light on this subject, and
enables me to give you the history of this young
couple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont belonged to a wealthy English aristocratic
family, and was the legal heir, on the death
of his father, to a large estate. As is too generally
the case where the law of primogeniture exists,
Belmont, as the eldest son, was not left to consult
his affections in a matter of so much importance as
marriage. A bride was chosen for him, long before
he was old enough to think of or care for a bride.
But when the boy became the man, he felt little inclined
to enter into so close a union as that of marriage
with one for whom not a single affection stirred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not long after the young man entered society,
he met Catherine H——, the only daughter of Lord
H——, a lovely young creature, who soon captivated
all his feelings. Catherine, it happened, had, like him,
been early betrothed by her parents. Her hand was
not therefore free. He might admire, but not love
her. Unlike Belmont, she was not indifferent toward
her betrothed. As they grew up together
from childhood, their young affections intertwined,
until the friendship of youth became love at mature
age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A year spent on the Continent, and particularly
in the gayest circles of Paris, tended in no wise to
elevate the moral sentiments of Belmont; nor did
absence from home weaken the attachment he felt
for Catherine H——, whose society he sought on
his return at every favorable opportunity. Between
the ardor of a lover who seeks to win a
heart, and the quiet, gentle, unobtrusive attentions
of one who believes that he has already made a love-conquest,
there is and must be a marked difference.
This was just the difference between the manner
of Belmont and the lover of Catherine. The lady,
not indifferent to admiration, found, ere long, the
image of the former resting upon her heart, and
hiding that of the latter. Belmont was quick to
perceive this; but the lover of Catherine, who was
not of a jealous temperament, remained altogether
unconscious that any change had taken place in
the feelings of his bride elect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From his false and delusive dream, something,
not necessary to mention, awoke Belmont; and
in the effort to break through the meshes of love in
which he was entangled, he left England, and spent
nearly twelve months in the United States. While
here, the beautiful site upon which he afterward
built himself an elegant residence, struck his fancy,
and, in a moment of enthusiastic admiration, and
with, perhaps, a half-formed resolution to attempt
what was afterward done, he purchased it, and
then went back to England. When he again met
Catherine H——, he was struck with the change a
year had wrought in her appearance; and he was
also struck with the marked expression of pleasure
with which she received him. The half-quenched
fire which he had been endeavoring to extinguish
in his bosom, again burst into a flame, and burned
more brightly than ever. In a moment of passion,
he avowed his love, and the maiden sunk in silent
joy upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meantime, the betrothed of Belmont, as well
as her friends, were fretted and angry with the
coldness and indifference which he manifested toward
her. A near relative, a young man of a fiery
temper, undertook to ask explanations, and considering
himself insulted by the answer he obtained,
sent Belmont a challenge to fight. This was accepted;
and at the hostile meeting which followed,
the young man received a severe wound that came
near costing him his life. Belmont took advantage
of this circumstance to break off all intercourse
with the lady, and to arm himself, ready to give any
of her friends who chose to espouse her cause,
whatever satisfaction they might desire. All this
caused a good deal of excitement in the circles immediately
affected by it, and a good many threats
were made by the lady’s friends; but they amounted
to nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Erskine, the lover of Catherine H——, at length
saw cause for suspicion that all was not right. He
had repeatedly urged her to consent to an early
performance of the marriage rite; but she had as
often evaded any direct response to his wishes.
At length there was no disguising the fact that she
was becoming colder toward him every time they
met. He complained of this; but his complaint
elicited no warm denial of what he alledged. Erskine,
who was deeply attached to the lady, now became
alarmed. It was too plain that she had grown indifferent.
Why, he was for some time at a loss to
understand. But at length his suspicions took the
right direction. Just as he was about demanding
from Belmont an explanation of his conduct toward
Catherine, the father of the latter died; and before
he could with any appearance of decency refer to
the matter after this afflictive occurrence, Belmont
left England, it was said, for America. His errand
to this country you know. As soon as he had completed
the improvements he had projected, he returned
home to consummate the purpose that had
been uppermost in his mind for nearly two years.
He married Catherine H—— secretly, and left for the
United States before the fact had transpired, bringing
with him his lovely and loving young bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not wonder that the servants sometimes saw
Mrs. Belmont weeping. Smiles could not always
rest upon her sweet face. And yet she was happy—that
is, happy as she could be under the circumstances,
for she loved devotedly her husband, and
he in turn almost idolized her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Erskine, when the truth became known, was
deeply afflicted at the infidelity of his ‘betrothed,’
and for a time suffered the severest pangs. The
reaction upon this was angry indignation, and a
final vow of retribution. The ardent lover was
changed to a cruel hater and seeker for revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll bide my time,’ he said, bitterly. ‘When
they think I have forgotten all, my hand will find
them out, and my shadow will fall upon them.
When their fire burns brightest, I will extinguish it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Year after year he nursed this bitter purpose in
his heart. He had found no difficulty in learning
where the young bride had retired with her husband,
and from thence he managed to obtain frequent intelligence.
All that he heard but made the fire of
hate burn fiercer in his bosom. Catherine was represented
as being happy amid her blooming children;
and the lovely spot where she dwelt was
described as a little paradise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen years were permitted to go by, and then
Erskine sought to effect his fiendish purpose. An
instrument by which this was to be done, came into
his hands, as he felt, most opportunely, in a young
man of fine exterior, elegant manners, intelligence,
and varied accomplishments, but without honor or
feeling. He was a perfect man of the world, and
at heart an unprincipled villain. The name of this
person was Edgerton. By loans of money and
other favors, Erskine attached this man to him.
The tie was, of course, that of self-interest. To him
he unfolded what was in his mind. He told him
of the wrong he had sustained, and the burning thirst
for revenge that ever since had filled his heart.
Then he described, in glowing language, the beautiful
spot where Catherine dwelt, and the happiness
that filled her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will you steal, as did the serpent of old, into
this lovely paradise?’ he asked. ‘I have been your
friend, but if you will serve me now, you may command
me in every thing. The wife of Belmont
you will find to be a lovely creature; and if you can
win her from him, as he won her from me, you
will gain possession of a magnificent woman. She
is a prize, Edgerton—just the prize for a man like
you. Gain it, and I will furnish you with all the
means of flight and security.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An adventure like this just suited the debased,
impure, heartless Edgerton; and he entered upon
it with an ardor of feeling, and coolness of purpose,
that too sorely foreshadowed success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For sixteen years scarcely a cloud had rested
upon the hearts of the happy family of Belmont.
He had three daughters, between each of whom
there was but little over a year’s difference in age.
The oldest was a tall, exquisitely beautiful girl of
fifteen, and her sisters gave the same promise of
opening loveliness. Just at this time, and while
Mr. Belmont was in search of a musical instructor
for his children, Edgerton managed to fall in his
way, and by the most perfect address and assumption
of a false exterior, to win his good opinion.
He showed credentials of ability from well-known
personages in New York and Philadelphia; and
also testimonials of character from eminent clergymen,
and others. These represented him as highly
educated, belonging to a good family, and distinguished
for high moral excellence. They were, of
course, spurious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Edgerton was introduced to the family
of Mr. Belmont, Mrs. Belmont shrunk from him with
instinctive aversion. This was her first impression;
but it slightly wore off during the interview; and
she was rather inclined, after he had gone away,
to think that she had permitted herself to feel prejudiced
against him without a cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After due deliberation, Edgerton was engaged
as instructor of the young ladies in music and the
modern languages—in all of which they had made
some proficiency; and also to superintend their
studies in other branches. To do all this Edgerton
was fully qualified. He entered upon his duties
with patience and assiduity. In all his intercourse
with the family he was modest and unassuming,
yet managed, in every conversation that passed
between himself and either Mr. or Mrs. Belmont, to
show that he possessed a discriminating, well-furnished
mind. He had traveled throughout Europe
and Asia Minor, and been an accurate observer.
This made him an interesting and intelligent
companion to both Belmont and his wife, who
had been over the same ground. In short, Edgerton
soon became the highly valued friend of the parents,
as well as the instructor of their children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For two years Edgerton remained in the family
of Mr. Belmont, during which time nothing occurred
to awaken a suspicion, or to shake his confidence
in the young man. About this time business required
him to go to New York. He was absent
over two weeks. Separation from his family was
painful to him, and therefore he hurried home as
quickly as possible. He had never, since his marriage,
been so long absent from his wife, and he
grew impatient to be with her again, and to hear
her voice, which, in memory, was sweeter than it
had ever seemed. He wrote her, during his absence,
many times, each letter warmer in its expressions
of tenderness than the one that preceded
it. In the last letter, written three or four days
before he reached home, he said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not think I shall ever venture to go away
from home again without taking you with me.
The separation has filled my heart with an indescribable
sadness. I think of you all the while; I
see you all the while; there is not a moment that I
do not hear the sound of your voice. But I cannot
press my lips to yours, glowing with love; I cannot
take you in my arms—you are not really present.
Dear Catherine! I shall soon be with you. Ah!
how the idea will force itself upon me that the day
must come when there will be a longer separation
than this. But I will drive the cruel thought from
my mind.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As Belmont approached his home, his impatient
spirit chafed at what to him seemed the slow pace
of the stage-horses, by which he was conveyed the
last twenty miles. At last time and distance intervened
between him and his earthly paradise no
longer. As he sprung from the horse that had
borne him with swift feet from the village, he felt a
slight chill of disappointment at not seeing his wife
at the door, with open arms, to meet him. In the
hall he was met by his youngest daughter, in whose
face there lighted up a smile, but it was not the
free, glad, heart-smile that ought to have been there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where is your mother?’ he eagerly asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not know. She went away somewhere
day before yesterday, before we were up in the
morning.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Who did she go with?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I don’t know. But Mr. Edgerton went away
at the same time. We think she went with him.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont caught hold of the door, and leaned
hard against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Where are your sisters?’ he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine has been sick ever since. I can’t
tell what is the matter with her; but she cries all
the time. Mary is in her room with her.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Does nobody in the house know where your
mother is gone?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, sir. She went away before any body was
up. But there is a letter for you in your room.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont tried to run up stairs, but his knees
trembled so, and were so weak, that it was with
difficulty that he could support himself. When he
reached his room, he grasped the letter to which his
daughter had referred, and sunk into a chair. It
was sometime before, with his quivering hands, he
could break the seal, and then many minutes passed
before he could read a line. The blasting contents
were as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='sc'>My Husband</span>,—How can I break to you the
dreadful truth that must be told? Long and devotedly
as I have loved you, and still love you, I
am impelled to leave you, under the influence of a
stronger, more fiery, and intenser passion. I am
mad with the bewildering excitement in which I am
whirling, as in the charmed circle of a fascinating
serpent. I do not love you less, but I love another
more. Forgive me, if you can forgive, and in mercy
both to you and to your unhappy wife, forget me.
You know not how I have been tempted and tried;
you know not how, by the most imperceptible approaches,
the citadel of my heart has been taken.
God forgive him who has wronged you, and her who
permitted herself to be made an instrument in that
wrong. You will be far happier than she can ever
be. As for my chil—’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Here the paper was blotted and soiled, as if by
a gush of tears. It contained no word more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An hour afterward, when Mary Belmont and
her younger sister stole softly into their father’s
chamber, they found him sitting motionless in a
chair, with the letter he had read crumpled in his
hand. His eyes were closed; and he did not open
them as they drew near. They spoke to him in
timid voices, but he did not look up, nor appear to
hear them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Father! dear father!’ they said, coming up close
to his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slowly he drew an arm around each, and pressed
them tightly to his bosom—but he did not utter
a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Papa, where has mother gone?’ asked Mary,
in a quivering voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I do not know,’ was the low, mournful reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Will she never come back?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No—never!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The children burst into tears, and wept for a
long time bitterly. The agitation of Belmont’s mind
now became agonizing. It was his first wish to
conceal what he felt as much as possible from his
children; he therefore asked to be left alone. Mary
and her sister retired from the room, but with slow
and lingering steps. When left to himself, the
father sunk down again, like one paralized, not to
think but to feel. An hour afterward, Ella, his
youngest daughter, came quietly in, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Papa, I wish you would see Catherine. She
does nothing but cry all the while.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feeling the necessity, at least for his children’s
sake, of rousing himself under this terrible affliction,
for which there was no healing balm, Mr. Belmont
arose, and taking the hand of Ella, went with her
to the chamber of his eldest child, now a tall, beautiful
young girl, in her eighteenth year. Her face
was turned toward the door when he entered. At
a single glance he saw that it was exceedingly pale,
had a strange expression, and was full of anguish.
In a moment after it was buried beneath the bed-clothes,
while the whole body of Catherine shivered
as if in an ague fit. Sobs and deep moans of
anguish followed. To all that the father could say,
not a word of reply was given. Suddenly there
flashed through his mind a dreadful suspicion, that
caused him to clasp his forehead tightly with his
hands, and stagger a few paces backward. Soon
after he left the chamber, and retired to his own
room to make an effort to think. But it was a vain
effort—all the elements of his mind were in wild
confusion. At one moment he would start up with
a fierce imprecation on his lips, resolved to pursue
the fugitives; but before reaching the door of his
room, a thought of the utter hopelessness of his condition
would cause him to droop, nerveless, into a
chair, or sink with a groan upon the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For nearly the whole of the night that followed,
Belmont paced, with slow and measured tread, the
floor of his chamber. Toward morning, his mind
became calmer and clearer. He was like a man
suddenly pressed to the earth by a burden that
seemed impossible to be borne, who had re-collected
his strength, and risen with the burden upon his
shoulders, feeling that though almost crushing in its
weight, he could yet bear up under it. The first
clear determination of his mind was to ascertain, if
possible, the cause of Catherine’s strange distress.
He had a heart-sickening dread of something that
he dared not even confess to himself. He felt that
the specious villain who could draw his wife from
virtue, would not be one to hesitate on the question
of sacrificing his child, if by any means he could get
her into his power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Late in the morning he left his bed, and had
nearly completed dressing himself when some one
knocked at his door. On opening it, he found Ella,
with the tears raining over her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, papa!’ she exclaimed, ‘Come, quick! and
see Catherine. I don’t know what’s the matter
with her, but she says she is dying.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cold shiver passed through every nerve of
the unhappy man. He sprung away at the last
word of Ella, and was quickly at the bed-side of
his daughter. A great change had taken place since
he saw her on the day before. Her face, that was
pale then, was now of an ashy whiteness, but her
eyes and lips had a calm expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Papa,’ she said, in a voice that thrilled through
the heart of the unhappy man, it was so inexpressibly
mournful, ‘I do not think I can live long. I
have a strange feeling here,’ and she laid her hand
upon her heart. ‘If I have done wrong in any
thing; if I have been betrayed into evil, I pray you
forgive the innocence that suspected no wrong, and
the weakness that could not endure in temptation.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine, my dear child! why do you speak
thus? What is it that you mean?’ asked her father.
‘Has that villain dared—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Belmont checked himself for he saw that
his daughter had become greatly disturbed. She
raised up partly from her pillow, while a rapid play
of the muscles agitated her whole face. Before,
however, she was able to articulate a word, she
sunk back paler than ever. Two or three deep
groans struggled up from her heart, and then all was
still—still as death. Mr. Belmont looked for some
time at the young, white face of his first-born and
dearly beloved child, upon which the great destroyer
had so suddenly set his seal, and then, answering
groan for groan, turned from the withered
blossom that lay before him, and again sought the
silence and solitude of his own room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two months subsequently to this, Erskine received
a letter from Edgerton. It was in these
words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>,—The work is done—and well
done. I have succeeded fully in my plans. Your
old flame has been with me in New York for a
month. But she takes the matter rather too hard,
and weeps eternally. I can’t stand this; and if she
does not improve very shortly, shall abandon her.
If it had not been for my wish to follow your instructions
to the letter, I should have taken the
eldest daughter instead of the mother, who is much
more to my fancy. I have not yet heard any thing
from Belmont, though I look every day for him to
pounce down upon me; but I am not afraid of him.
I suppose this affair will drive him half mad, for he
was exceedingly fond of his wife. This I mention
for your particular gratification. You may expect
to see me in England by the next arrival. Whether
I shall bring my lady-love along or not, I cannot say.
It is, however, doubtful. Addio.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Edgerton.</span>’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The death of his oldest daughter, under circumstances
of so much doubt and distress, added to the
desertion of a beloved wife, wrought a great and
melancholy change in Mr. Belmont. I only saw
him a few times afterwards, and then it was at his
own house, where I was called to visit as a physician.
A few months had made the impression of
years. His face was thin, and marked with strong
lines; his countenance dull and depressed; his eyes
drooping and sad. He moved about slowly, and
spoke in a low, quiet, pensive voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One cold night in November, some six or seven
months after the afflictive events just described
had occurred, Mr. Belmont, after laying awake for
hours, trying in vain to sleep, arose from his bed,
and going to the window, stood there for some time.
The moon was shining brightly through the clear,
frosty air, making every object distinctly visible.
After standing at the window for some time, Belmont
was about turning away, when his eye was
arrested by a figure that came slowly along the
main avenue through which we drove up to the
house a little while ago. Sometimes it would stop
for the space of a minute, and then move on again,
until at length it stood in the clear moonlight, directly
under his window. He then saw that it was
a woman. Her head was bowed down at first, but
soon she looked up, and the moonlight fell strongly
upon her face. Belmont started with a low exclamation,
and retreated from the window, and staggering
back, sunk with a groan upon the bed, where he lay
for nearly five minutes. He then arose, dressed
himself, and descended with a deliberate air. On
opening the hall-door, he perceived that the woman
had sunk down upon the steps. She did not move
at his approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine!’ he said, in as firm a voice as he
could assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there was no motion—no reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine!’ But she did not answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stooping down, he placed his hand upon her,
and then she looked up, and the moonbeams fell
upon her face. Her lips were thin and tightly compressed;
her pale cheeks deeply sunken; her eyes
tearless, but, oh! how full of mingled penitence,
humility, and hopelessness. She uttered no word,
but lay upon the cold marble, at the threshhold of
her husband’s mansion, with her eyes fixed upon
his face, that, if not stern and angry, betrayed no
sign of affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine,’ he said at length, in a cold, steady
voice, ‘you have returned to the old home that
your conduct has made desolate. I do not see that
you have been any happier than those you left behind.
I forgive you, as I hope God will. I believe
you were once worthy of all the love I bore you,
and for the sake of what you then were, I will not
spurn you back from the threshhold you now seek
to pass.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He then took her arm, and raising her up, conducted
her into the house, and up into her old
chamber, where every thing remained as she had
left it. The thoughts and feelings of other days
came rushing upon his heart, but he sternly drove
them back. It was too late. They could never
again have place in his bosom. What she thought
and felt is not known, and can hardly be imagined.
In the old chamber Belmont left his fallen wife, with
but a single word, and that a caution to remain
where she was until he visited her in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont did not again retire that night. Until
near day he was busily engaged in writing, and in
evident preparation for a journey. About 5 o’clock
the servants were aroused, and directed to prepare
an early breakfast. The coachman was ordered to
have the carriage at the door by 7 o’clock. Then
Ella and Mary were awakened by their father,
who desired them to dress immediately, and come
to him in the library. When there, he informed
them that it had become necessary for him to leave
for England immediately, and that he wished them
to accompany him. All necessary preparation could
be made in New York, where he would remain two
or three weeks. The girls were surprised, as may
well be supposed, by this announcement; but their
father was too much in earnest to leave them room
to ask for a longer time to prepare for the journey
than he had given them. Precisely at seven they
entered the carriage and drove into Heathdale. On
arriving there, Mr. Belmont said that he would have
to return, and that while he was gone they must
remain at the hotel. Mary wanted to go back with
him for something that she had forgotten, but he
said that he would rather have her remain where
she was, in a tone that prevented her from saying
any thing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The object of Mr. Belmont in returning, was to
have a parting interview with the mother of his
children, for whom he could not but feel the deepest
commiseration. But her own hands had placed
the burden upon her heart, and it was not in his
power to remove it. She had been false to her
marriage vows, and false to those who had called
her by the tender name of ‘mother.’ He could not
again take her to his bosom, nor again bring her
back among her children. He found her a sad
wreck, indeed, and could scarcely keep back the
tears when he met her again, with the searching
light of day making visible all the marks of grief,
crime, and suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Catherine,’ he said, in a voice that trembled,
spite of all his efforts to be composed, ‘I meet you
now for the last time. I shall return to England,
never again, I hope, to visit this country. This is
your home for life, if you wish to make it so. I have
settled upon you an annuity; and these papers,
which I leave here upon the table, will give you all
necessary information in regard to the manner of
drawing it. I will not upbraid you for what you
have done, for I do not wish to add a single pang to
the thousands you must suffer; I would rather
mitigate than increase them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My children,’ she said, in an eager voice, as he
paused, ‘where are they—am I not to see them?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But two remain,’ Belmont replied, ‘and you
cannot see them. You are dead to your children,
and must remain so. Catherine is in heaven. She
died, to all appearance, of a broken heart, a few
days after you went away.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole frame of this wretched woman
quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Dead!’ she ejaculated, in a deep, hoarse
whisper; and then covering her face, wept for some
moments violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘But Mary and Ellen,’ she at length said, looking
up with streaming eyes. ‘May I not see them?
They are my children, Edward, and, erring and
sinful as I have been, I still love them. Do not,
then, in mercy, deny me this, the only boon I will
ever ask at your hands. Oh! Edward, let me see
my children once before I die.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Belmont was deeply moved, but his purpose did
not falter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You are dead to them, Catherine,’ he replied,
with assumed coldness, ‘and must remain so.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even on her knees the wretched woman prayed
to see her children; but she prayed in vain. Hard
as it was for Belmont to resist her agonized entreaties,
he remained firm to his well-formed
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The moment of parting with her, and leaving
her in loneliness and misery on the very spot where
she had once been so happy, and with a thousand
things around her to remind her of that happiness,
was a most painful one. It was with difficulty that
Belmont could restrain the desire he felt to take her
in his arms, press her to his bosom, and forgive and
forget all. But her sin had been too deep—she had
fallen too low. He could not throw over the past
the blessed mantle of forgiveness; and so he left
her alone, to shiver by the cold ashes of a darkened
hearth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has her husband never returned?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! Five years have passed since he left,
but no one has seen him in this region. There
came a rumor a few years ago, that he had met
Edgerton, and made him account with his life for
his crime. But I know not whether this be so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year afterward I received a letter from my
excellent friend, the doctor, in which he mentioned
that death had given the unhappy Mrs. Belmont a
kind release; “and, we may hope,” he remarked,
“that through much suffering she was purified and
forgiven.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A COUNTRY SKETCH.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. M. N. M‘DONALD.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, to <span class='it'>my</span> mind, a nicer young man doesn’t
live any where than Archie Harris. So pleasant
spoken, so good tempered, so civil as he is. You
‘may go farther and fare worse,’ I can tell you,
Sophy. It’s all very well for girls to be dainty and
particular about looks, when they are young and
handsome themselves, and think they may catch
anybody, but it’s no joke for a girl to settle herself
with a man who may be unkind to her by and bye.
Archie Harris has that in him which will last in
dark days as well as sunshine; something that wont
wear out in old age, like your grandfather here,
that I’ve lived with forty-five years come next
Christmas, and found him just the same, winter and
summer. So, as I said before, ‘you may go farther
and fare worse,’ Sophy.” And having delivered
her sentiments, old Mrs. Middleton took a pinch of
snuff, drew her chair a little nearer the fire with an
emphatic “hem,” and then resumed her knitting,
while she glanced over her spectacles to observe
what had been the effect of her speech upon her
pretty granddaughter, who was seated on the
opposite side of the little round table, engaged in
sewing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy Middleton plied her needle with something
of a petulant air, while her grandmother spoke, and
answered with a slight tone of vexation—“Everybody
can’t think alike, that is certain. Archie Harris
is well enough in his way, but he isn’t the only
man in the world, that is one comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why don’t you like him?” pursued the old
lady, resolved not to give up the point. “Tell me
of one in the whole place that is better, or kinder,
or cleverer. <span class='it'>I</span> never saw such a one at any rate,
and once upon a time, Sophy, you thought Archie
a little better than most folks yourself, and have
only changed your mind since Philip Greyson came
home, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Philip Greyson, indeed!” exclaimed Sophy, with
a toss of her head, while her cheeks crimsoned in
spite of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Philip Greyson,” said the old lady. “I
suppose you think, Sophy, because I wear spectacles,
I am half blind, and can’t see as far as I used
to do. But I have my eyes about me, and maybe
spy a little farther for my glasses, and I fancy that
Philip, with his spruce uniform and navy buttons,
will make you forget poor Archie altogether.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure,” said Sophy, whose thread at that
moment had got into such a knot that her undivided
attention was necessary to disentangle it. “I’m
sure Philip Greyson is nothing to <span class='it'>me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he never may be, indeed,” said Mrs.
Middleton emphatically. “These young midshipmen
are wild blades, my dear, and I should never know
a minute’s peace if you were to marry one. But
Archie Harris, ah! Sophy, he is the husband for
you; such a good son and brother—so quiet, and
steady, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stupid,” said Sophy, supplying with a laugh the
word for which her grandmother paused. “Why,
last night at Mrs. Morgan’s he scarcely said ten
syllables, and say what you will, grandmother,” she
continued, roused by the recollection of her last
evening’s visit, “everybody likes a merry, talkative
beau, who has seen something of the world, better
than a fellow who sits by with a long face, and can
do nothing to amuse one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that fellow isn’t Philip Greyson, I guess,”
said her grandfather, who, on the opposite side of
the fire, was calmly knocking the ashes from his
pipe. “Phil is one of those chaps that have no lack
of words in any company, if I may judge from the
way in which I have heard him chatter at his own
father’s table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chatter! that he can, like a magpie, and with
but little more sense, to my mind,” said the old lady.
“If Archie Harris speaks but seldom, his words are
always to some purpose, and he doesn’t think it
amiss to be civil to old people either. Philip has
enough and enow to prate about to young folks, but
if an elderly person comes by, he is at no pains to
entertain him. Times have changed since my day,
when young men and women were taught to reverence
their betters. Ah! well,” and Mrs. Middleton
drew a long deep sigh, and shook her head significantly
as she leaned over to mend the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the prettiest, neatest white house, in the
main street of a pretty village, somewhere in the
Empire State, that Sophy Middleton and her grand-parents
resided. Samuel Middleton, who from his
silvery hair, and general knowledge of past events,
together with the melancholy fact that he is totally
blind, has long been dignified with the title of “the
oldest inhabitant,” which title, by the way, the old
gentleman particularly glories in, being fond of relating
anecdotes of the place, which happened when
he was a boy, and adventures with persons long
since dead, and though Brookville has not improved
materially during the last twenty years—being off
the rail-road—yet the old man imagines in his blindness
that great changes have taken place, because
the Episcopalians have built a church, and Squire
Edgewood a new house and barn, and descants
largely upon the good old times, when Brookville
was just settled, and “no folly or fashion had got
into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A youth of industry—for it was not until advancing
years that darkness fell upon him—had secured
for Samuel Middleton a moderate competency, and
at the old homestead, with the kind partner of his
joys and sorrows, and the orphan child of an only
son, he had learned to bear with patience and fortitude
the sore trial which it had pleased God to
send him; thankful for the past, contented with the
present, and fearless of the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy, so early orphaned as scarcely to remember
any other care than that of her grand-parents,
was the life and light of the old man’s home. Her
cheerfulness beguiled very many of his wearisome
hours, and her merry voice, and mirth-inspiring
laughter, seemed to cheat him of half his sorrow.
He knew her step upon the gravel walk when she
came in from school, as readily as if his sightless
eyes could have looked upon her face, and felt only
too proud and happy when his friends said “that
Sophy was growing up a comely girl, and would be
a beauty one of these days.” As his beloved child
grew older, this prophecy seemed likely to prove
true. Sophy’s blue eyes were full of vivacity, and
her oval cheeks and sweet lips were colored with
Nature’s pure carnation. By degrees the scrawny
figure of the school girl was moulded to the grace
of early womanhood, and we introduce Sophy Middleton
to our readers, at this particular moment, a
blooming country maiden of nineteen summers,
very much petted at home, sufficiently admired
abroad, and therefore a little, very little bit <span class='it'>spoiled</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But who is Archie Harris, that we find the old
lady eulogizing so warmly? Why, Archie Harris
and our Sophy went to the same school; sat on the
same bench; learned out of the same book, and
were friends from the time they were “no bigger
than a midge’s wing.” Being next door neighbors,
this friendship had strengthened with their years
rather than diminished. Sophy had found a sister
in Mary Harris, and, in the natural course of things,
a lover in Archie; and although no positive engagement
existed between them, it seemed such a matter
of course that they should love each other, and
so desirable a connection on both sides, that everybody—that
wise person found in all villages—said
it would certainly be a match at some future day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Philip Greyson, too, was a Brookville boy, and
had been a schoolmate of Sophy’s years ago. But
Philip’s ambition soared higher than a life of usefulness
at home. He longed to see the world; to brave
the ocean; to tread on foreign shores; and when,
through the influence of friends at Washington, he
procured a midshipman’s warrant, and left Brookville
to join his vessel at Norfolk, what cared he for
aught he was leaving, when the future stretched so
brightly before him? His parents, teachers, school-fellows,
he bade them good-bye without a moment’s
regret; and as to Sophy Middleton, if he thought of
her at all, it was but as an unformed girl, rather
more indifferent to him than his own sisters, and
whom he might perhaps never see again. On his
return, however, after a three years’ cruise, Philip
found, to his surprise, this same little Sophy grown
a young lady, and a pretty one, too; and, charmed
at the sight of so much beauty where he least expected
it, renewed his acquaintance with delight,
while Sophy, pleased and flattered by his attentions,
and dazzled by the glitter of his gilt buttons, danced
and flirted with the young midshipman to her heart’s
content, exciting the envy of sundry other damsels
to whom nature had denied bright eyes and rosy
lips, and vexing poor Archie, by her unwonted
vanity, in the most uncomfortable degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Sophy related to her grandmother what
passed between Archie and herself on the previous
night, as they walked home from Mrs. Morgan’s tea-party,
the old lady would have been inexpressibly
distressed, for Archie, in the warmth of his feelings,
upbraided Sophy for her coquetry and coldness,
which Sophy’s high spirit would not brook. She
bade him remember that no engagement had taken
place, and therefore she was free to choose for herself,
though everybody seemed to think—why she
could not tell—that because they lived next door to
each other, they were “as good as married.” Philip
Greyson, she said, was an old friend as well as he,
and she would not give up the pleasure of talking
to him, if she liked, for <span class='it'>anybody</span>, and so at the garden-gate
they parted, with a cold “good-night.” Archie
to mourn over the fickleness of the girl he dearly
loved, and Sophy to dream of—Philip Greyson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably Mrs. Middleton suspected something
of this, however, from her urgent appeal to her
granddaughter in behalf of their neighbor’s son, and
might, perhaps, have gone on still further to expostulate,
had not a knock at the outer door interrupted
the conversation; and Sophy, who had risen to
answer the summons, returned in a few minutes
with a letter directed to her grandfather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A letter for you, grandfather,” she said, placing
it in the old man’s hand. “Mr. Norris sent it up
from the post-office. It came by the late mail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For me?” said Mr. Middleton, turning it over,
and placing his finger upon the large, red seal.
“I did not expect any letters just now. Read it,
wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Middleton, who had been adjusting her
spectacles, eagerly seized the mysterious letter, and
carefully cutting it open, read the signature aloud.
“Henry Willetson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know such a person,” said the old man,
leaning forward to catch every word. “Go on,
Hannah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The letter was a brief one; and the old lady
glanced her eye over it before she began—but that
glance was sufficient to tell the whole story. There
it was, written down in few but fearful characters;
and suddenly throwing the paper upon the table,
she exclaimed, “Merciful Father! we are ruined!
All swept away! Oh! Samuel, Samuel, what shall
we do in our old age? All gone, all gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what it is. Let me know the whole
truth,” said the old man, groping his way to the
table, and stretching his hand over it to find the
letter. “Tell me what has happened, Hannah—I
can bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All gone, all gone!” murmured poor Mrs. Middleton,
as if deprived of the power to say more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is gone? Tell me, Hannah?” said the
agitated old man. “Oh, this awful blindness! Sophy,
where are you? Do you read it for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pale and trembling, Sophy obeyed. The letter
was from the agent of a mercantile house in New
York, in which Mr. Middleton had been persuaded
to invest the bulk of his small property, announcing
the entire failure of the concern, which would not,
in all probability, at the winding up of its affairs,
pay five cents on the dollar; and thus the fruits
of patient industry, during the best years of Samuel
Middleton’s life, were swept away by the reckless
speculation of others, and nothing remained to
him, save the pretty cottage in which he lived,
and the good name which no dishonest act had
ever tarnished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had the old man been in the possession of his
eye-sight, the blow had not, perhaps, fallen so
heavily; but unable by personal exertion of any
kind to repair the mischief, with no children to lean
upon, his bark seemed stranded among the breakers,
and Samuel Middleton bowed his head upon his
hands, and sought for strength, in this hour of darkness,
from the source whence alone he felt certain
of obtaining it. There was silence for a few moments
in the little apartment, disturbed only by the
stifled sobs of poor Sophy, and the moans of Mrs.
Middleton, as she rocked backward and forward in
her arm-chair, till the old man spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have received good at the hand of the Lord,
and shall we not receive evil?” he said. “Hannah,
this is a sore trial—but it comes from God, and we
must submit. If He sends poverty upon us in our
old days, depend upon it, He will send strength to
bear it. The trouble and the comfort always seem
to go hand-in-hand. Let us be thankful it is no
worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems the worst that <span class='it'>could</span> have happened,
Samuel,” said the old woman, her voice choked
with sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The worst!—oh, no! Think if we had been
parted by death, Hannah; or if Sophy had gone off
with some wild, idle fellow, or many another thing
that might befall us. Don’t cry, Sophy, darling, grandfather
specially grieves on your account. But it’s
all for the best, dear child. I feel as sure of that as
I do that I sit here this moment. Wife, don’t moan
so; it isn’t Christian-like to despair. God’s will
be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! husband, if I had your faith; but it comes
so sudden, I can’t seem to bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the Bible, Sophy,” said her grandfather,
“and read to grandmother and me how Job bore the
loss of all his possessions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy brought the Bible, and read with trembling
voice, as Mr. Middleton directed. When she had
finished, the old man knelt down, and reverently
clasped his hands. He prayed for the patience of
the patriarch of old; for faith to believe it was in
love as well as wisdom they had been afflicted;
for entire and cheerful submission to the Divine
will; and strengthened by this near approach to the
Great Chastener of his children, the little family lay
down to rest that sorrowful night, tranquil at least,
if not altogether resigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before noon the next day, everybody in Brookville
had been made acquainted with the misfortune
of the Middletons; and neighbors came with
kind offers, which the old man could not accept.
He had settled what to do, he told them, and thought
it was the best plan. The white cottage must be
sold or rented, and, indeed, he had already dictated
a letter, which Sophy had written, to a gentleman
in New York, who was looking for a summer residence,
and had once expressed himself pleased with
the situation of Mr. Middleton’s house, and the
scenery about Brookville. The income accruing
from this would enable him to hire an old broken-down
tenement, about five miles off, where they
would remove without delay, and with strict
economy, and good use of a little garden-plot,
become as contented, he hoped, if not as happy,
as they once were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this arrangement, reasonable as it appeared,
everybody objected, and suggested, of course, something
else. One would take Sophy to live with him;
another would help to pay the rent of a better place;
and a third proposed some other grand expedient;
but the old gentleman was firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you, my friends,” he said, “but I would
keep my independence if I can. Let me feel that I
still eat my own bread, though it be coarser and
harder than it once was, and pray for a contented
heart, which seems to lighten almost any burden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A purchaser for the neat homestead was easily
found, in the gentleman to whom Sophy had written
by her grandfather’s dictation; and at the appointed
time, Samuel Middleton and his family removed
to their new abode, not, however, until kind hearts
and willing hands had contributed to make the old
place tolerably comfortable; to lay out and improve
the garden, long run to waste, and even to plant a
few rose-bushes and flowering shrubs about the
door-way, that Sophy’s eyes, if not her grandfather’s,
might find some pleasant memento of Brookville
and its inhabitants, in these silent marks of their
affection and respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When moving-day came, everybody came to help.
Squire Edgewood’s men and fine team, and Mr.
Harris, with his strong market cart, to transport the
furniture, and when these were fairly off, arrived
neighbor Maynard’s light wagon, to carry Sophy
and her grandmother down, with sundry small
baskets and boxes, while the minister himself drove
the old gentleman in his gig; and it was sad, though
soothing, to catch the kind farewell words as they
passed down the village street, when many a one
pressed forward to shake hands, and to wish “good
health, and God’s blessing on their new home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And over this new home, in answer, perhaps, to
these good wishes, some benevolent brownie seemed
already to preside; for when Mrs. Middleton unpacked
her valuables, she found, stored away in
cupboards, supposed, of course, to be entirely empty,
such loaves of cake, and jars of butter, with preserves,
pickles, eggs, et cætera, as to excite her
astonishment in the highest degree; nor could any
inquiries or surmises detect the mysterious donors;
and the old lady, amid her sighs and bemoanings at
their altered condition, could not but smile as she
surveyed the kind remembrances; and Sophy, poor
girl, would have smiled too, since she duly estimated
the kind feelings which had induced them, but that
she was too miserable for any thing to interest her
now—so home-sick and lonely, that she cared for
nothing, save the luxury of shedding tears, when
she could steal away from her grandmother’s side,
and, unobserved, weep over the change which had
so suddenly befallen them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all this time, amid these adverse circumstances,
where were Sophy’s admirers? Was she
to find them only <span class='it'>summer</span> friends, who, like migratory
birds, flew off in darker weather? Alas! it
seemed too true. Once or twice after their removal
Philip Greyson rode down to Mr. Middleton’s, and
then Sophy resumed her smiles, and was happy;
but his visits were few and far between, and she
learned that a pretty girl in the midst of plenty and
prosperity was very different from a pretty girl
fallen in fortune, and obliged to perform all sorts of
menial offices for her grand-parents. But Archie
Harris, the companion of her childhood, surely <span class='it'>he</span>
might have come to offer consolation, where he
knew it was so much required. Was it altogether
right in <span class='it'>him</span> to stand back under such circumstances?
Sophy felt it was unkind, “unbrotherly,”
as she mentally termed it, yet could scarcely blame
him either, when she remembered their last conversation,
the indifference she had evinced toward him,
and the decided preference she had given to Philip;
and while her heart smote her for this, she felt more
inclined to forgive a coldness which she had herself
so entirely provoked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our friend Archie, however, despite his seeming
indifference, had not forgotten. He had been
wounded to the quick by her preference for his
rival; and the manner in which she appeared to
rejoice that no previous troth-plight would prevent
her accepting Philip, made him feel how little she
valued true affection, when compared with a dashing
exterior, or a greater share of personal beauty. “Let
her go! the vain, cold-hearted girl!” he mentally ejaculated,
as they parted on that eventful night. “Let her
try if he <span class='it'>can</span> love her half so well as I do—as I <span class='it'>have</span>
done,” he added more bitterly. “Fool that I was, to believe
she ever cared for me. That conceited peacock!
I wish—” and Archie, the best-tempered, kindest-hearted
creature in the world, conceived from that
moment such an unutterable dislike and contempt
for all navy officers, and navy buttons, as to wish,
in his awakened ire, that Philip Greyson was on the
coast of Africa, or the deep waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when misfortune came, Archie’s resentment
at once gave way. Sophy was in sorrow, and he
longed to go and assure her that his love was
brighter than any skies could darken. But had she
not rejected his love? Then why should he urge
it now? Philip was still at Brookville, and might
follow up the advantage he had gained; and Archie
would not for the world have interposed his own
wishes. Pride, therefore, more than anger, kept
him back from any other attention than common
civility required; and he resolved by every means
in his power to drive away the remembrance of the
past, and wait as calmly as he might the issue of
future events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While such was the state of affairs with Archie,
Sophy Middleton, in her new home, was learning
many valuable lessons, which, perhaps, she had
never gained but for these untoward circumstances.
Lessons of patience and submission, of industry,
activity, and economy; and though she did not recover
her usual flow of spirits, still, as the months
rolled on, and her employments increased, a tolerable
degree of cheerfulness returned also. She
found pleasure in her garden-beds and flower-borders;
pleasure in leading her good old grandfather
about through the house and ground, making
him familiar with every thing, and instructing him
how to find his way, unaided, to the arm-chair in
the porch; pleasure, too, in devising plans with her
grandmother for the better arrangement of their
little household, that pleasure which ever comes
with the faithful discharge of duty; and if Sophy
could not forget, if she still remembered Archie’s
slighted love with bitter self-reproach, or Philip’s
short-lived admiration with mortification and disdain,
she was still calm, and patient, and resigned; less
gay, perhaps, but not less loveable or lovely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first year of their misfortunes had passed
away, and during that time Archie and our heroine
had met but seldom, when the calm current of the
blind man’s life was ruffled by the intelligence that
Mr. Wilson had “sold out,” and the white cottage at
Brookville gone into other hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the beloved home of his early years, and of
his married life, should belong to another, had always
seemed to Samuel Middleton but as an unpleasant
dream, from which he vainly tried to rouse himself,
and believe that it was, indeed, a reality. He could
not discern the changes around him, or miss the
familiar objects which still lingered on his memory;
and this news, communicated rather abruptly by his
wife, on her return from a visit to Brookville, appeared
to awaken all his past regrets, and remind
him anew of other and happier days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did Wilson sell, I wonder?” he said.
“Dear me, I’m very sorry for it. I’m afraid somebody
may get there who will abuse the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will make no difference to us <span class='it'>now</span>, grandfather,”
said Sophy, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know as to that,” replied the old gentleman,
rather testily. “I don’t know as to that.
Wouldn’t it make you feel badly, Sophy, to walk
past there, and see every thing going to rack and
ruin? And if I can’t see it, I can remember just how
it all looked when we came away. If any one should
cut down those two elm trees in front of the house,
it would go nigh to break my heart, I think. Why,
my father planted those elms with his own hands
when I was a boy; and I do hope nobody will cut
them down while <span class='it'>I</span> live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not, indeed,” said Sophy, in a soothing
tone, “but I don’t suppose there is much danger of
that, grandfather, they shade the house so pleasantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not,” said Mr. Middleton, fidgeting in his
chair, as if the very idea had made him nervous,
“but there is no telling how it will be. People
are so crazy to make money now-a-days, that nothing
is safe. Who did you say had bought it,
wife?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t hear his name,” replied Mrs. Middleton;
“but I was so busy with other matters, that maybe
I didn’t ask. However, we can hear all about it
to-morrow, Samuel, for to-morrow is election-day,
you know, and Mr. Harris says he must have your
vote, and they’ll send down their wagon for you
and me in good season, so that we can take a dish
of tea with them, if Sophy don’t mind being alone
<span class='it'>one</span> afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy expressed her entire willingness to remain
at home, and, indeed, was rejoiced at the prospect
of so doing; and at the appointed hour next day,
when Mr. Harris’s wagon came rattling down the
lane, gladly assisted her grand-parents to prepare for
their visit, and saw them drive away with, it must
be confessed, a feeling of relief, somewhat difficult,
perhaps, to analyze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead, however, of setting about the various
little tasks which, to beguile her loneliness, Mrs.
Middleton had suggested, Sophy sat down by the
window, and was soon lost in deep thought. What
was the subject of her meditations, I think I <span class='it'>would</span>
not tell, even if I could, because I do not choose to
betray all the weaknesses of my sex; but I am sure
her eyes were wet, and her face very sorrowful,
when who should come trotting to the door but
Archie Harris himself, the very last person in the
world one might have expected on election-day,
when everybody, young or old, was, or ought to have
been, busy at the Brookville poll. Be this as it may,
however, here, as I said, came Archie, who threw
the bridle of his pretty bay pony over the gate-post,
and walked into the sitting-room, saying, “I met your
folks just now going to the village, and hearing you
were at home, called to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy received him with a mixture of reserve
and cordiality quite unmistakable, and a blended
shower of tears, smiles, and blushes, which Archie
interpreted favorably, I suppose, for he said, “Then
you <span class='it'>are</span> glad to see an old friend once more,
Sophy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly I am, and it is a long time since you
were here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long! let me see—six weeks, I guess. You
don’t call that a great while, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I do,” replied Sophy, blushing. “We
are so lonely now that we have learned to think
much of our friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you?” said Archie, regarding her with a
look half pleased, half sorrowful, as if some painful
recollection at that moment crossed his mind; “that
is enough to make <span class='it'>some</span> of us almost glad that you
have left Brookville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! never say you are glad of <span class='it'>that</span>!” cried
Sophy, earnestly, “when it made me so unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not glad on some accounts, certainly,” said
Archie, “not that you should have met with misfortune,
but only because you think more of old
friends here than there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True! real friends are the same everywhere,”
said Sophy, not exactly knowing what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes—not always,” replied Archie, significantly.
“But if friends bring bad news, are they
less welcome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe you have any <span class='it'>bad</span> news to tell
me this afternoon,” said Sophy. “You look very
well pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! it is not disagreeable news to <span class='it'>me</span>, but perhaps
it may be to <span class='it'>you</span>,” said Archie, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hear it, then,” said Sophy, “or maybe
I can guess it. Mr. Wilson has sold the old place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the old place has changed hands again, and
<span class='it'>I</span> think for the better; but that is not the news I
mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do tell me, then,” said Sophy, impatiently, “for
I cannot guess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” said Archie, suddenly becoming grave,
“it may make you sorry; and if so, I had rather
not be the one to tell it; but—Philip Greyson is
married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all?” asked Sophy, blushing to the very
eyes at the mention of Philip’s name. “I thought
your news was <span class='it'>bad</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And don’t you <span class='it'>really</span> care about it?” said Archie.
“Let me look in your eyes, Sophy, and see if you
are in earnest—if you really do not care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, I <span class='it'>do not</span>,” said Sophy, looking in
Archie’s face with a smile which spoke entire truth.
“I should not care if he had married all the girls in
Brookville.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thought differently once,” said Archie,
“and I am not sure, Sophy, that you will care to
hear an old story of true love over again, after the
last talk we had on the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Archie! will you never forget that foolish
business!” exclaimed Sophy, bursting into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People forgive easier than they forget, sometimes,”
said Archie; “and I can’t, for my life, forget
any thing that concerns you. I may be mistaken,
but I think, that, after Philip Greyson, you care
more for me than any one else; and now that he
is married—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sophy answered him with a glance, which told
a whole story of penitence, and a world of reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you think I could make you happy, as I
would try to do, dear Sophy,” he continued, “why
then, perhaps, you wont object to go back to
Brookville, and live with me at the ‘old place,’
and take grandfather and grandmother with you,
hey, Sophy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Sophy was crying so heartily, from a mingled
feeling of joy and sorrow, that she could not
answer, and so Archie proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been very fortunate this last year. I
suppose, because I had nothing to draw me off
from business, and have been able to buy the place
from Mr. Wilson. I will put it in good order again,
and we shall be <span class='it'>so</span> happy there—shan’t we, Sophy,
darling? But you don’t speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am so happy that I have no words
to tell it,” replied Sophy, smiling through her
tears. “But will you really forgive all my foolishness
and vanity, dear Archie? And shall we really
go back to Brookville; to the ‘old place’—and with
<span class='it'>you</span>, too? Oh! it seems like a blessed dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dream that will last, I hope,” said Archie,
“and pay us for all the sorrow we have had the
past year—for you haven’t been sad alone, Sophy;
I have thought of you, and loved you just the same;
and longed to come and tell you so, often and
often, only I thought if you did like Phil Greyson
best—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please don’t name him again,” said Sophy.
And Archie, nothing loth to discard a disagreeable
topic, promised—I believe with a kiss—that he
would not. Unfortunately for grandmother Middleton’s
little jobs, Sophy found the time pass so
rapidly that she quite forgot them—since Archie
stayed all the afternoon, while his poor horse stood,
kicking off the flies, at the garden-gate—wondering
it may be, at his master’s unusual delay, or sudden
love of gossiping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman and his wife came home in
excellent spirits, having heard who had become
the purchaser of their former abode, and Mr. Middleton’s
mind quite at ease respecting his favorite
elm trees; and when they learned further of all
that had occurred during their absence, and how
their darling Sophy—now so smiling and happy—was
to become the mistress once more of the dear
‘old place,’ their cup of joy and contentment
seemed full to overflowing. Grandmother reminded
Sophy that “she had told her a year ago that Archie
Harris would make the best husband in the world—always
excepting <span class='it'>her</span> old man;” while grandfather
could only clasp his withered hands, and
raise his sightless eyes in silent ejaculations of
gratitude and love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Genuine lovers of love stories like to hear of that
devoutly wished-for consummation—a wedding;
but editors, and some other people, best fancy
jumping at the conclusion at once. So, most kind
reader, whoever you may be, please to imagine
Archie Harris and his bride quietly settled at Brookville
before the autumn commenced—the happiest
people in the wide world; while grandmother is
busiest of the busy, all day long, in her accustomed
haunts; and grandfather sits under the shadow of
his beloved elms, almost forgetting his misfortunes,
or their year of exile, in the added happiness of his
darling Sophy.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mr. Oakly</span> was a rich man. Stately dwellings
and noble warehouses were his; he owned large
and flourishing farms, and the sails of his ships
whitened the ocean. No man enjoyed a higher
reputation on ’change; no merchant’s opinion was
more quoted or depended on; no man’s integrity
considered more spotless. Blest, too, with an excellent
wife, the world pronounced Mr. Oakly a very
happy man. But where the mere surface of things
forms the criterion of judgment, the world, wise as
it is, is very apt to be mistaken. Mr. Oakly was
<span class='it'>not</span> a happy man. Neither was he a favorite with
the multitude; and had not the magic of riches surrounded
him, he would have had fewer professed
friends, and many more open enemies—for his
manners were arrogant and repulsive, while his
deeds of charity were but as a feather in the scale
with his <span class='it'>power</span> of being charitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakley had paid a great price for his riches—no
less a jewel than his own peace of mind. He
might count over his heaps of gold, and talk about
the just reward of long years of industry and economy,
and try to cheat even himself into the belief
that his prosperity was but his deserts, yet well he
knew that the foundation of his fortune was based
on crime. Flatter himself, then, as he would, the
whispers of conscience told him louder than the
jingling of coin that it was mockery all! His only
child, too, was miserably deformed and lame; thus
it proved, with all his great wealth, he was neither
an enviable or a happy man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakly, with his family, were spending the
warm months at his delightful country-residence on
the banks of the Susquehanna; and there our
story takes us on a sultry August morning. Breakfast
is just over, and now, while Mr. Oakly breaks
the seals of various letters which the postman has
just brought to the door, Mrs. Oakly listlessly looks
over the city journals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So John is dead at last!” exclaimed Mr. Oakly,
with something of relief in his tone, and throwing
down upon the table a dirty-looking letter, with a
huge black seal. “Died a pauper! Well, I expected
it, and so might he, when he refused compliance
with the wishes of his friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly looked up with some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of whom are you speaking, my dear—a relative
of yours?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only my brother,” replied her husband, coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother—and died a pauper! You amaze
me! Pray how did it happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It happened, and justly, too, through his own
folly and imprudence,” cried the cold-hearted man—for
even had his brother been the basest of criminals,
he was his brother still. Death should have inspired
some faint shadow of grief, if no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is,” continued Mr. Oakly, “John was
too much favored in early life. He was my father’s
idol, and, to my disadvantage, favor after favor was
heaped upon him. Although younger by several
years than myself, <span class='it'>he</span> was sent to college, <span class='it'>I</span> was
kept at home—<span class='it'>he</span> had choice of a profession, <span class='it'>I</span> was
forced to measure off tape and calico by the yard.
He became dissipated, was wounded in some rowdy
frolic, fell in love with, and married, a girl of low
family, who took care of him during his illness.
Such conduct highly exasperated my father, who
vowed that unless he would abandon this low connection
forever, and return home, he not only would
disinherit him, but would never see him more.
John refused the terms; the consequences were as
my father had said, who shortly after died. I was
his only heir, and, of course, as such, was bound to
hold all my father’s views sacred; and as he never
forgave my ungrateful brother, consequently, neither
did I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for Mr. Oakly’s version of his brother’s
history. We shall see, by and bye, how far it may
be depended upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But were you not aware of your brother’s destitute
situation?” said Mrs. Oakly, somewhat reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, not exactly—at least I—I did not know
it for a <span class='it'>fact</span>. But, what then—suppose I did; he
chose his own path—what had I to do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did your brother leave any family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so it seems—for here comes a begging
letter from some country scribe, whereby it appears
he has left a widow and two children—girls, too;
but read it yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly took the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Your brother, Mr. John Oakly, was buried
yesterday at the expense of the parish. Upon his
death-bed he requested that notice should be forwarded
you of the event, and some assistance solicited
on behalf of his destitute family. He leaves a
widow, in delicate health, and two small children,
both girls. As they are without any means of support
save the little which the mother can earn by
labor, I trust this appeal to your sympathy will not
be in vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Oakly, looking
inquiringly at her husband, as she finished reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” echoed her husband, “what concern is
it of mine if they do starve! It was all owing to his
connection with this same woman that his misfortunes
fell upon him; and now do you think I am
going to encourage her arts by aiding her in her
justly deserved poverty—no, not I, Mrs. Oakly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Revoke that cruel sentence, I beseech you,
Alfred,” said his wife; “you surely will not let this
appeal to your sympathy pass without notice; do
not, I entreat you, let the poor little ones suffer for
their parents’ fault!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mrs. Oakly,” cried her husband sarcastically,
“really, I hope I may do as I please with
what is mine. Those who have no money of their
own, and never had a cent in their lives, may well
cant upon charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was evidently a bitter meaning couched
under these words, for Mrs. Oakly colored deeply,
and tears filled her eyes, though she made no reply,
but throwing open the window upon the lawn, was
about to step forth, when the nurse entered the room,
leading by the hand a poor deformed little girl apparently
about two years of age. The sight of his
only and unfortunate child appeared to awaken a
new train of ideas in the mind of Mr. Oakly. For
some moments he walked the room in deep thought,
now looking at the child, now at his wife, and then
again resuming his measured tread. At length motioning
the nurse, with her charge, to leave the
room, he approached his wife, and in a much less
arrogant manner, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, a new idea has occurred to me, which,
if I mistake not, may be productive of much good,
not only to ourselves, but also to those for whom
your sympathy appears so foolishly urgent. The
more I consider of my purpose, the better I think
of it. My brother, it seems, has left two little girls—very
well. Now I propose taking the youngest
of these children as our own—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is indeed noble of you, my dear husband!”
exclaimed Mrs. Oakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In lieu of our own poor Agatha,” said Mr.
Oakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly screamed, and clasping her hands,
sat pale as marble looking up into the face of her
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, my dear,” said he, taking her hand with
some tenderness, “I dare say you will feel very
badly at first, but only consider the benefits which
will arise from the exchange. Agatha is a poor unhappy
object, and as long as she lives, will be a
sorrow and reproach to us. It will be very easy
for me to induce this woman, my brother’s widow,
I mean, to yield up one of her own children to me,
upon the condition that if she will take all future
charge of our poor Agatha, her own shall be brought
up in every tenderness and luxury. There is one
proviso, however, to which I shall require oath—that
is, the transaction is to remain forever secret—she
is never to claim her own child, but on the contrary,
to acknowledge Agatha as hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakly paused, but his wife made no reply. It
seemed as if surprise and grief had deprived her of
speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can pursue our plan the better,” he continued,
“as we have always kept Agatha secluded
from observation. It will be very easy for us now
to give out word that she is under skillful treatment.
By degrees we can report of her wonderful improvement,
until at the end of some months, or even a
year, we can produce our adopted child in proof of
our assertions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why is it necessary to do this?” cried Mrs.
Oakly, falteringly, “why not keep our own poor
unfortunate, and at the same time adopt one or both
of your brother’s children? God knows, Alfred,”
she added, earnestly, “I will be a mother to them—I
will cherish and love them; but, oh, not so tenderly
as my own poor Agatha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense, nonsense!” interrupted Mr. Oakly,
hastily, “don’t you see how much disgrace and
trouble you will save yourself by my arrangement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Disgrace</span>, Alfred! and from our innocent babe!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear me, if you please. You will have the
double satisfaction of knowing that she will be well
provided for, and kindly treated, while at the same
time she can never trouble you by her agitating
presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to such a woman as you have described
your brother’s wife to be, would you confide so
precious a trust?” said Mrs. Oakly, hoping this
appeal might arrest her husband’s views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? She may be well enough for our
purpose; her kindness I can secure by money. As
to any refinement, or education, it will never be of
much importance to Agatha. She will never be
called upon, it is likely, for any display of accomplishments,
poor thing—to eat, sleep, and read verses
in the Bible, will fill up the measure of her days
better than any thing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This cutting and cruel remark aroused all the
mother. Rising to her feet, she said, slowly and
emphatically,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alfred Oakly! can you speak thus lightly of your
own flesh and blood! Now, shame upon you! God
has given us this unhappy child; she is our own to
love and protect. Were she the loveliest babe that
ever fond mother circled to her heart, I could not
love her more. I might be proud of such an one;
but <span class='it'>love</span>—oh, I could not so deeply, so tenderly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there we differ, Mrs. Oakly; it is precisely
because she is such a child that I am anxious to be
rid of her,” replied the heartless father. “Understand
me, my dear, I wish no harm to poor Agatha;
it is for her good, I assure you, that the change
should be made. What answer, then, have you to
my plan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will never consent to it,” she replied,
firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well—you will not. Then it must be done
without your consent. I am fixed; neither your
refusal, or your tears, will avail any thing; so you
may as well make up your mind to yield, madam,
without further argument.” So saying, Mr. Oakly
turned coolly on his heel and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now wo to the poor wife—for well did she know
her husband’s unfaltering determination. If it is
possible for a woman to be too amiable, Mrs. Oakly
was so; while her husband, far from appreciating
such a character, ruled over her like some petty
despot. Her only hope now rested upon the belief
that the widow could never be induced to give up
one of her children for the unfortunate Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, would she were ten times more repulsive!—my
poor child!” cried the unhappy mother, “<span class='it'>I</span>
should still love her, but <span class='it'>she</span> would shrink from an
object so unsightly.”</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the close of a chill, rainy day, near the
middle of September, that a handsome traveling-carriage
drew up at the door of a small inn, in a retired
country town. Such an occurrence was rare;
and no sooner, therefore, was it seen entering the
long street of straggling houses, than it was followed
by a noisy set of bare-footed urchins, yelping dogs,
and idle loungers, so that by the time it reached the
inn, a motley assemblage was formed around it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the carriage stopped, the glass was let down;
a thin, sallow face looked sharply forth, and a voice
not the most gentle, demanded,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, some of you—can you tell me where one
Widow Oakly lives?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlord, who by this time had reached the
scene of wonder, imperatively thrust aside all other
aspirants to the honor of answering the stranger,
and himself began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Widow Oakly—ah, yes. The Widow Oakly
you said, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure I did. I ask you to direct me to her
residence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, sir. Well, you see the widow lives
in that small house yonder, on the bank of the creek—that
is, she has a room there; an honest little
woman, but poor—very poor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drive on!” cried the gentleman, sternly, without
deigning further notice of the loquacious landlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver cracked his whip, and the spirited
horses obeying the impulse, dashed through the
crowd at the imminent risk of trampling some of
the throng under their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, I told you,” cried the landlord, “there
was something uncommon about them Oakly’s,
poor as they are; and now you see what a grand
coach comes after them. Run down there, Jimmy,
my boy, and find out what it means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not only Jimmy, but a dozen others set off
on full trot in the rear of the carriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the object of so much curiosity
had reached the house pointed out as the residence
of the widow; and carefully mincing his steps across
the muddy pathway, Mr. Oakly rapped loudly at the
door with his gold-headed cane, for knocker there
was none. After several repetitions of the same,
each more vehement than the last, the door was
finally opened by a middle-aged woman, whose red
face, and scowling brows told she was in no very
pleasant frame of mind. Around her head was tied
an old black handkerchief through which, in several
places, her grizzly hair shot up like “quills upon the
fretted porcupine.” She was slip-shod, and stockingless—her
dress drabbled and torn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she exclaimed, not at all daunted at sight
either of the carriage or its owner, “what’s all this
rumpus—what do you want, that you knock a body’s
house down about their ears?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a Mrs. Oakly lives here?” inquired the
gentleman, involuntarily retreating a step or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if there is—what do you want?” said the
woman, surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my business,” answered Mr. Oakly,
looking daggers. “If there is such a woman here I
must speak with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go round to the other door, and knock
that down too,” replied the woman. “<span class='it'>Eh</span>, maybe
you are one of her husband’s relations. I’ve heard
tell he had powerful rich ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakly turned away without deigning reply to
this half interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Eh</span>,” she continued, her voice becoming shriller
and shriller, “and a plaguy proud set you are, I’ll
be bound. You can ride in your coach, can you,
and let your brother, as maybe he was, die on straw.
<span class='it'>Ho-oo-t!</span>” she shrieked, her face inflamed with anger,
as she found her taunts unnoticed, “<span class='it'>ho-oo-t</span> away
with you off my door-steps—did you ever hear of
Dives and Lazarus? Your gold wont keep <span class='it'>your</span>
back from scorching, old Dives. Faith I should like
to have the basting of you myself!” Saying which
she boxed the ears of the nearest unlucky wight
who stood grinning with the rest at her eloquence,
and then giving him a shake, which nearly sent his
head off, she slammed the door, and retreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her last words were inaudible to the person they
were intended for. Glad to escape from such a
virago, he had hastily bent his steps around to the
back entrance of the domicil. Here he knocked
several times, but as no answer was given, he
ventured at length to lift the latch, and enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a low, dark room in which he found himself,
little better than a cellar. I fancy it would have
been impossible even for those who dwell upon the
charms and romance of poverty, and who, with
well-fed stomachs, in slippered ease, on Turkey
carpets, descant so eloquently upon this theme, to
have found aught charming here. The floor was
broken and uneven; two low windows, which could
only boast of three whole panes between them, the
rest being patched with paper, or their places supplied
by rags, through which the rain had forced its
way, and now trickled in long streams across the
floor. There were two chairs, a low bedstead,
miserably furnished, a pine table, and some few
articles of crockery and cooking utensils of the
poorest kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon an old quilt, thrown down upon the floor
in one corner of the room, two little children, entwined
in each other’s arms, were sleeping. At this
sight the knees of Mr. Oakly trembled, his teeth
chattered, and for a moment he leaned for support
against the wall—for a voice seemed whispering in
his ear, “<span class='it'>Look wretch! thy brother’s children—this is
thy work!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And perhaps it will be as well here as elsewhere,
here, in the scene of that brother’s death, to relate
the events which led to so sad an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mr. Alfred Oakly’s summary of his brother’s
life, there was some truth, but not the whole truth.
John <span class='it'>was</span> the favorite of his father; for beside that
his mind was of a much higher order than his
brother’s, his disposition and deportment were also
far more amiable and respectful. Mr. Oakly preferred
not sending both his sons to college, so he
very wisely resolved it should be the younger, as
one whose talents would most honor the expense.
This excited the envy and jealousy of Alfred, and
from that moment he resolved to work his brother’s
undoing. It happened that at the same college—and
in the same class with John Oakly, was a wild, dissipated
fellow of the same name, who was continually
getting into disgrace. Accident furnished Alfred
with this clue, which he determined should lead to
his desired wishes. By degrees whispers of misconduct
began to reach the father’s ears. Then
came letters to corroborate these rumors, filling the
heart of Mr. Oakly with sorrow. Letters, too, were
continually being received, demanding money,
which, if forwarded, it is unnecessary to say never
reached its destination. Mr. Alfred took good care
of that; for, of course, the letters his father received,
purporting to be from his brother, originated in his
own wicked mind, while those actually penned by
John, as also his father’s, were suppressed by the
same crafty power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Alfred first originated this scheme, it is
probable he had no idea its success would result in
so much misery; his desire was as much to be revenged
on his father, for his partiality to his brother,
as upon his brother for being the object of that partiality;
but when once he had entangled himself in
the meshes of deceit, he could not break through
without sure detection of his wickedness. The
father and son met but once after the latter went
to college. He was then received with coldness
and reproaches. Conscious of his innocence, John
was too proud to make any explanations, and left
his father’s roof in bitterness. Soon after Mr. Oakly
went abroad, as wretched as his son, leaving Alfred
in sole charge of his business. The constitution
of John was never strong; and no doubt the unmerited
treatment of his father hastened the work
of disease. He commenced the practice of the
law, but in pleading his first cause, unfortunately
ruptured a blood-vessel, and was borne from the
court-room to his lodgings in apparently a dying
state. Through the kindness and careful nursing
of the lady with whom he boarded, he at length
partially recovered; or it may be that the beauty
and gentleness of Louisa, her only daughter, contributed
somewhat to his restoration. Certain it is,
a mutual affection sprang up between them, and,
though in no situation to marry, the death of her
mother a few months after, by which Louisa was
left alone and destitute in the world, brought the
event about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now love and poverty were henceforth to
bear them company on their life-journey—for a final
blow was put to any expectation which John might
have indulged secretly of a reconciliation with his
father, through the machinations of his brother. It
seems the other John Oakly had, in the meanwhile,
absconded with a girl of low character. Of this fact
Alfred availed himself, and communicated the same
to his credulous father, who immediately wrote to
his youngest son, that unless he renounced at once,
and forever, the disgraceful connection, he would
disinherit him. This letter, as referring to his darling
Louisa, the most amiable and lovely of wives, filled
John with indignation and anger. He answered
the letter in terms which nothing but his feelings as
a <span class='it'>husband</span> could excuse—and the rupture was complete.
Mr. Oakly soon after returned home in miserable
health, and died, cutting off John entirely in
his will, and leaving the whole of his property to
Alfred. This event the latter communicated to his
brother, generously enclosing a <span class='it'>fifty dollar</span> note, with
the assurance that as his father had died so incensed
against him, out of respect to that father’s memory
he must decline all further intercourse with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When sickness and poverty meet, the path of
life’s pilgrimage is hard. Too unwell to practice
his profession, John attempted writing, but this at
best was precarious, beside that the exertion again
brought on pain in the side, and difficulty of breathing.
He had fine talents, and had health permitted,
no doubt might have succeeded as a writer. Sometimes
he would dictate, and his faithful Louisa
commit his ideas to paper; but this could not continue.
New and precious cares were added, which
required all her time, so that this resource was
abandoned. He soon grew so feeble as to be unable
to leave his room. A kind physician recommended
country-air, and through his assistance the unfortunate
couple, with their two little ones, were
enabled to reach a small country town. Here living
would be cheaper, and hope whispered to Louisa
that by industry and economy, she might support
comfortably her dear husband and little ones. Poor
girl! on offering herself as a seamstress, the good
people looked at her with surprise—they did all their
own sewing. She offered to teach painting or music,
at very low rates; but they laughed at her, and
wondered what she thought they wanted of such
foolish fashions. At last she was thankful, for her
children’s sake, to be employed even in the most
menial offices, if thereby she might get them bread.
Once did John Oakly address a letter to his brother,
in which he stated his ill-health and destitution. It
was never answered. Again, on his death-bed, did
he give to the clergyman who attended his last moments
his brother’s address, requesting him to write
when he should be no more, and crave that assistance
for his babes, which, while he lived, was refused
to <span class='it'>him</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this appeal is already known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unfortunate widow met with little sympathy
from her rough neighbors. Not that they meant
unkindness or uncharitableness, but each one was
too busy with their own affairs to give more than a
chance thought to a poor widow and a stranger.
They were themselves industrious and frugal; and
it was difficult for her even to get a day’s work from
such economical, thrifty people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And hither now had the rich man come—and on
what errand? Not to sympathize—not to succor or
relieve, but to prosecute his own selfish views, both
cruel and unnatural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return. We left Mr. Alfred Oakly gazing
upon his brother’s sleeping babes. The opening of
a door aroused him; he turned, and the wan countenance
of the widow met his view. She did not look
to be more than three-and-twenty. She was tall, and
her figure slender and delicate, but her small feet
were bare, her garments coarse. On her sunken
cheeks there was no trace of color, and the lines of
suffering too plainly drawn around her beautiful
mouth. Her dark eyes were large, but their brilliancy
dimmed by tears of sorrow, and her long,
raven hair—that splendid hair that had once been
the admiration of all—was now combed carelessly
back from her high brow, and concealed by a plain
muslin cap. The man of the world was abashed,
and the widow the first to break the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presume I speak to Mr. Alfred Oakly,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman bowed, but had his life depended
upon utterance, he could not have spoken. Their
mother’s voice, though low, at once aroused the
sleeping innocents, and springing from their hard
couch, they bounded to meet her. At sight of a
stranger, however, the youngest, not two years old,
hid her face in the folds of her mother’s dress, but
the elder looked up inquiringly into his face, and
then raising herself on her little toes, and putting
back her sunny ringlets, said, “Me will tiss you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakly <span class='it'>did</span> stoop to those little rosy lips, and
even lifted the little creature for a moment in his
arms; but that was all—he placed her on the floor
again, as cold, as unimpassioned as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This little scene overcame the fortitude of the
mother; folding both little ones to her bosom, she
burst into tears, and for many moments wept bitterly.
This gave Mr. Oakly time to recover himself. He
would fain have believed the tears of the widow
called forth more for effect than for real grief; but
there was something too lofty and pure in her pale
countenance to encourage such base thoughts. At
length feeling himself bound to say something by
way of consolation, in a husky, fettering voice, he
began. The words “we must all die—sorry—death—unfortunate—in
heaven—” being alone intelligible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if indignant with herself for having given way
to her feelings in the presence of one so heartless,
Mrs. Oakly instantly dried her tears, and with something
of scorn on her features, listened to this lip-language—for
well she knew the heart had little to
do with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come here,” he continued, “as the near
relative of your late husband, to remove you from
this miserable spot. You must leave this place,
madam; it is entirely too poor and wretched for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretched and poor as it is, on <span class='it'>that</span> bed your
brother died!” said the widow, pointing as she spoke
to the low, miserable bedstead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Oakly was evidently put down. After a moment’s
silence he added,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my intention, as my brother’s widow, to
treat you with every kindness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your kindness, sir, comes late,” replied Mrs.
Oakly, “and will prove but thankless. He whom
it should have rescued from the grave, is now beyond
your cruelty; and to me, therefore, your <span class='it'>kindness</span>,
as you term it, is little else than cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brow of Mr. Oakly contracted with anger,
but the object he had in view was too important to
be thwarted by a woman’s reproaches; so, dissembling
his mortification, he continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you to remove from here at once to a
pleasant town which I shall name to you; and it is
also my desire and intention to adopt your youngest
child as my own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Separate me from my children! No, that you
shall never do!” cried the widow, pressing them to
her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be so hasty in your decision, my dear
madam,” said Mr. Oakly, blandly, “but listen to me
with reason. This child shall be most tenderly and
carefully brought up. My wife will love her as her
own; and her education shall be the best which the
city can give. You yourself shall not only live in
comfort, but also have ample means to educate
your other daughter as you could wish. Nay, more;
I do not ask you to give me your daughter without
an equivalent. Now,” continued he, drawing his
chair still closer to Mrs. Oakly, and taking her hand,
“I want you to listen to me—neither do I wish you
to give me an answer to-night; you shall have time
to reflect upon my proposition, and to consider well
the immense benefit which will result to yourself
from conceding to my wishes, or, in case of refusal,
the poverty and wretchedness which will still surround
you and these poor babes, aggravated, perhaps,
by the thought that you might have spared
their tender frames, but would not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The countenance of the widow flushed with indignation;
she spoke not, however, but turning her
full dark eye upon him, prepared to hear what further
this man had to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has pleased the Almighty,” he continued, “to
give me one child, now nearly three years of age;
but this child he has blasted with the most hopeless
deformity. You have two beautiful children—then
give me one, and receive to your maternal care my
poor, blighted Agatha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And are you a <span class='it'>father</span>! and can you talk thus
easily of severing the holy bond of parent and
child!” interrupted Mrs. Oakly. “Have you not a
wife—is there no <span class='it'>mother</span> to be consulted in your
most unnatural scheme!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—an unhappy mother; but she has already
consented. Aware that in perfect retirement her
poor child can alone know happiness, she is willing
to yield her up to your gentle treatment, and will in
return bestow her love and tenderness upon your
own babe. Reflect, you will still have one lovely
child to console you, while the future welfare of both
your children will be secured by the sacrifice;
furthermore, there will be the heartfelt pleasure of
knowing that through your watchful care an unfortunate
being is made happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know aught of the pleasures of <span class='it'>duty</span>,
that you talk so feelingly?” said the widow, scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, reproach me not thus; look at your two
children, those little beings confided to your care—can
you see their little frames wasted by hunger, or
sinking through toil; or, should you die, what then
is there for them but a cold and bitter lot of poverty
and death—or maybe a fate worse than death.
You shudder; then why hesitate, when by simply
yielding to my wishes you are all made comfortable
and happy. I see you are moved. I have but one
stipulation to make, should you consent, as I think
you will; it may alarm you at first, but upon reflection
you will see its propriety. It is this—you are
to promise solemnly never to claim your child, but
to acknowledge poor Agatha to be <span class='it'>yours</span>, and never,
on any account or any emergency, divulge this important
secret. Do not answer me,” said he, hastily,
as he saw the widow was about to speak; “take
time to consider my views—I will call at an early
hour in the morning for your reply. Good night!”
Then kissing the half-frightened children, the plausible
brother of poor John Oakly softly closed the
door, and once more entering his carriage, returned
to the inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to conceive the pain and agitation
with which this interview filled the breast of the
poor widow. Doubts distracted her; and decision
either way filled her with dread. One moment she
resolved to spurn the offered ransom from poverty,
the next, as her eyes dwelt on her helpless little ones
doomed by such decision to years of toil and want, she
wavered, and almost consented to part forever with
her darling Louisa, if by the sacrifice their comfort
might be secured. Then her mind wandered to the
poor, cast-off Agatha, whom, perhaps, cruelty and
harshness might destroy. She had well divined
the father’s selfishness, and should she refuse the
charge, he might entrust her to other hands less
faithful—for already she felt her heart warm toward
the unfortunate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unconscious of their mother’s distress, the children
had once more fallen asleep. Softly removing
the little arm of the youngest from her neck, she
carefully placed them on her humble bed, and then
kneeling down beside them, she prayed that strength
and resolution might be given her that she might
decide justly and wisely. Mournfully the wind
sighed around that dismal dwelling; the rain beat
against the shattered windows—but she heard it
not, knew it not. Through that long, long night,
without lamp or food, unto the dawning of another
dismal day, the widow remained on her knees by
the bed-side of her beloved children. Years seemed
added unto her by the sufferings of that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her decision was made—made with an anguish
which mocks at consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blame her not, fond mother, as, surrounded by
all the comforts of life, you fondly circle your own
dear babes to your bosom, and think no power but
death can separate you from them. Blame her not,
that in poverty and destitution, in forlornness and
widowhood, to save her poor infants from a lot so
wretched, she at length, with grief too deep for tears,
decided to yield up forever to <span class='it'>another</span>, her youngest
born—her darling Louisa.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>To a pleasant seaport town, many miles distant
from the scene of the preceding chapter, and still
further removed from the residence of Mr. Oakly,
our story now takes us. We must allow, too, for a
flight of years, which shall be as noiseless as those
circling so swiftly around the head of the young and
happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of one long street, consisting
mostly of mechanics’ shops, a few stores, a rope-walk,
and a tavern, the dwellings, clustered here
and there in a most picturesque and delightful
manner. The land rising rather abruptly a few rods
from the shore, and slightly undulating, gave to each
little cottage a distinct and pretty appearance, each
with its little garden-plot of bright-green vegetables
and brilliant flowers, some half hidden behind the
huge brown trunks of forest-trees, others mantled
with the vine or honey-suckle. To the south and
west, the horizon rested upon the bosom of the
majestic ocean; northward towered hill on hill until
the blue sky kissed their dark summits; while to
the east stretched a beautiful vista of finely cultivated
fields, and glowing orchards, with the spires
of distant villages proclaiming—<span class='it'>God above all!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the hour of noon, on a bright June day.
A band of happy, sportive children were just let
loose from school, and with whoop and huzza, with
careless laugh, and merry song, away bounded the
gay young things, happy that the four brick walls of
A B C-dom were behind them, yet now and then
glancing back with a look of fondness to their school-mistress,
as she slowly crossed the play-ground to
her own residence. In the path before her gayly
frolicked a beautiful girl of perhaps ten summers, the
very embodiment of health and innocence, skipping
and dancing onward, light as any fairy, or with
sunny smiles bounding back with a flower and a
kiss for the child her mother was so tenderly assisting.
This poor little creature was not only very
lame, but was terribly hunchbacked, and otherwise
deformed. Although really older than little Ruth
Oakly, (for in the school-mistress the reader finds the
widow,) she was not taller than most children at
five. One little hand was clasped in her mother’s,
(she knew no other mother,) who, with the most
tender care, guarded her steps, now and then, as
the eyes of the child were lifted to hers, stooping
down to kiss her, and encouraging her in the most
endearing terms. The other hand held a wreath of
flowers, which she had woven for her dear sister
Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they entered the gate opening upon the nicely
graveled walk leading up to the cottage-door, Ruth
ran and brought a little arm-chair on rollers, softly
cushioned, and placed it on the grass beneath the
shadow of a large apple-tree, whose pendant
branches, nestling down amid the sweet clover,
thus formed a beautiful bower for the <a id='child'></a>children’s
sports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Gatty,” cried Ruth, flinging herself down
at her feet among the clover, “now let’s play the
story you were reading this morning. You shall be
queen, and I will be the little girl that was never
happy; would it be wrong, Gatty, to <span class='it'>play</span> you were
never happy—would it be telling a lie; for you know,
Gatty, dear, I am very, very happy—aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—very happy,” said Agatha, thoughtfully,
“but, Ruth, I cannot be queen, you know—how I
should look! No, you must be queen; and see, I
have made this pretty wreath on purpose for you.
I will be the ugly old fairy, and ma’ma shall be Leoline,
that was never happy—for, Ruthy, do you
know I think dear ma’ma is sometimes very miserable.
I wonder what makes her cry so; for every
night when she kneels down by our bed-side I can
feel the hot tears on my cheek as she kisses me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! and so can I—poor ma’ma!” said Ruth, and
both children remained sad and thoughtful, the arm
of Ruth thrown across the lap of her sister, whose
little hand, still clasping the wreath, rested on
Ruth’s shoulder. At length Agatha spoke, but her
voice was low and broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” said she, “maybe ma’ma weeps for me,
because—because—I am not more like <span class='it'>you</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How like me?” said the little girl, raising her
eyes to the sad face bent over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you know, Ruth, you are so straight and
so pretty, and can walk so nicely, while I—I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a thousand times better than me, dear
Gatty,” cried Ruth, springing up and throwing both
arms around her weeping sister—for it was almost
the first time she had ever heard Agatha allude to
her deformity; “indeed you are a great deal prettier
and better. Oh! how many times I have heard
dear ma’ma say she wished I was as good as you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth,” said Agatha, laying her hand on her
sister’s arm, and looking earnestly in her face, “I
<span class='it'>am</span> a frightful looking child, am I not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span>, Agatha!” exclaimed little Ruth, “<span class='it'>you</span>
frightful! O, no; don’t every body love you, Gatty,
dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody is very <span class='it'>kind</span> to me,” said the child,
unconsciously making the distinction—“but then,
Ruth, sometimes I hear people say, ‘<span class='it'>O, what an
ugly little thing!</span>’ ‘<span class='it'>Did you ever see such a fright?</span>’
and then sometimes the children call me a <span class='it'>spider</span>,
and say I have arms like an <span class='it'>ape</span>, and cry, ‘<span class='it'>Hunch-Bunch,
what’s in your pack?</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, stop, dear Agatha!” said Ruth, tenderly
kissing her, “don’t talk so—pray don’t! it is only
rude stranger children that say so; it is because
they don’t know what a sweet, dear child you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pray to God every night,” continued Agatha,
“to forgive them, for they don’t know what it is to
be lame, and deformed, and helpless; and I pray God
to make <span class='it'>me</span> good and amiable, too, that <span class='it'>I</span> may forgive
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cry, Gatty, dear,” sobbed Ruth, and then
both little heads sunk lovingly together in a
paroxysm of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Oakly came to call the children to
dinner, she was surprised to find them both weeping
and sobbing bitterly. There was never any concealment
from their mother; so Ruth, in a simple,
earnest manner, related the conversation between
Agatha and herself. Mrs. Oakly was grieved to
find the mind of her hitherto happy child dwelling
on a subject so hopelessly calamitous. Raising the
poor little girl in her arms, she fondly kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My darling,” said she, “is it not better to be
good and lovely in your heart, than to possess the
most beautiful form, and yet be wicked, and have
no love for God and his commandments? My dear
little girl, listen to me; it was the will of the Almighty
to strike you with lameness, and to render your
frame less pleasing to the sight than that of other
children; but reflect how many blessings he has
also granted you. Suppose you were blind; suppose
you could never look upon the face of your dear
little sister Ruth, or your ma’ma’s; could not see the
beautiful flowers, nor the grass, nor yonder ocean,
which you now so much love to look upon, or the
beautiful blue sky above you; or, Agatha, what if
you were deprived of speech and hearing. Ah!
my child, do not sorrow any more, for you see
how good God has been; you must not let the
speech of thoughtless children thus disturb you—will
you promise me, Agatha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will <span class='it'>try</span>, dearest ma’ma—I must not promise,
for I may be wicked again, and forget that God is
so good,” answered the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Alfred Oakly had so far fulfilled the promises
he made the widow as to remove her from the
wretched spot where he had first sought an interview
with her to the home she now occupied. He
had purchased the cottage, which was pleasantly
located, and presented her with the title deed. He
had furnished it neatly, adding also a piano, and a
small collection of books, to the other equipments.
Half yearly she received a stipulated amount of
money, which, though small, would, with economy,
have been sufficient for her support, had she chosen
to avail herself of its uses. But this sum she considered
sacred to Agatha. In case of her own death,
she saw how utterly hopeless and dependent her
situation would be, and she nobly resolved not to encroach
upon it any more than was absolutely necessary
for the first six months. She therefore exerted
all her energies to support herself and the children,
independent of this allowance. In this laudable endeavor
she found the piano one great resource.
She gave lessons in music, also in drawing and
painting, and was engaged as teacher in the village
school, in which capacity she was much beloved
and respected both by parents and children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus years rolled on. Although she still grieved
for her darling Louisa, and wept in secret those tears
of which none but a <span class='it'>mother</span> may know the bitterness,
still she was most fondly attached to the unfortunate
little Agatha, while the affection subsisting between
Ruth and the poor deformed was truly lovely to
witness. There could not be a much greater contrast
than in the looks of these two children, although
their dispositions were in perfect harmony. Ruth
possessed a rich olive complexion, with cheeks
which might vie with June roses, they were so
bright and glowing; her eyes were black and sparkling;
and her raven hair closely cut to her beautifully
rounded throat, was parted on top of her finely
formed head, and waved over each temple in one
rich, glossy curl. Her figure, tall for her age, was
light and graceful. The complexion of Agatha, on
the contrary, was dazzlingly fair, save where dashed
by the small, violet veins; her large, deep-hazel
eyes possessed that peculiar brightness and intensity
which usually designates those who suffer from like
causes; long ringlets of light-brown hair, fell around
her almost to the ground as if to hide within their
beautiful redundance the mis-shapen form of their
little mistress. But it was the expression of her
innocent face which called forth the pity and kindness
of every one; that look, so gentle, so confiding,
as if pleading with every one to love her, though
she knew how hard it would be to take to their
hearts a helpless deformed little object such as
she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Incapable of joining in the sports of other children,
Agatha devoted a great portion of her time to reading,
of which she was passionately fond; and possessing
a retentive memory, she was better informed, perhaps,
at ten years of age than most children at fourteen.
She had a great taste for drawing and for
music; these Mrs. Oakly had assiduously cultivated,
knowing what a source of comfort and amusement
they would afford her, and also contribute to
draw her from dwelling too much upon herself and
her misfortunes, which would only tend to sour and
destroy her happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From its proximity to the sea, and consequent
advantages of sea-bathing, the village in which Mrs.
Oakly resided was, in the summer season, a frequent
and favorite resort for invalids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a certain wealthy bachelor of the name
of Sullivan, who, for two successive seasons, had
made this his place of residence. Every one granted
his claim to invalidism the first season, but when
with robust frame, and fresh, healthy countenance,
he appeared the second, people shook their heads,
and talked of <span class='it'>hypocondriacs</span>. By and bye, it began
to be whispered about that Mr. Sullivan was often
seen coming from the little cottage of the Widow
Oakly; and at last it was asserted that he was soon
to bear off their good school-mistress as his bride.
This was all true. Mr. Sullivan was talented,
agreeable, good looking, and rich; one who, in his
youthful days, need not fear the frown of any damsel,
and who now, in the prime of manhood, might still
have won the fairest. But the heart of the handsome
bachelor seemed invulnerable, for nearly forty
years resisting all the charms of beauty. He came
to the seashore to restore his head, and lost his heart.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>thought he, blushing like a school-girl at his ridiculous
plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acquaintance between Mr. Sullivan and Mrs.
Oakly commenced by means of the children. He
one day met them on the beach as they were
gathering shells, and being always interested in
children—a sure sign that his heart was good—he
stopped to speak with them. The beauty and
vivacity of Ruth charmed him, while her unfortunate
little companion filled him with deep sympathy and
pity. By and bye he found himself thinking less of
the children and more of the mother, until in fact he
made the astonishing discovery that he was in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly, now in her thirty-eighth year, had preserved
her beauty through all the troubles and vicissitudes
of her life. There are some forms and faces
we see, upon which time appears unwilling to lay
his withering hand—and Mrs. Oakly was one of
these. The rose yet lingered on her cheek; her
eyes were still soft and brilliant; her mouth had not
lost its freshness, nor her teeth their pearly hue,
while the dark hair folded over her fine brow was
as thick and glossy as in the days of girlhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You may be sure the bachelor was not for any
long delay in the matter—that “Happy’s the wooing
that’s not long a doing,” was precisely his idea—so
he made proposals at once, and was accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening previous to her marriage, Mrs.
Oakly addressed a letter to Mr. Alfred Oakly, informing
him of the event, though she entered into
no particulars, not even giving the name of her intended
husband. All the request she made was,
that he would continue to place the same amount
of money which he had previously forwarded to
her, in some safe deposit, for the benefit of Agatha;
that should she survive those whose happiness it
was now to do for her, she might not be entirely
thrown upon the cold charity of the world. Not
one word did she breathe of her yearning for her
own precious Louisa; she felt he would not understand
her if she did, so she coldly bade him farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The marriage was solemnized in the widow’s own
little parlor; after which, amid the tears and blessings
of the villagers, Mrs. Sullivan departed with
her happy husband for his beautiful residence near
Lake George.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We will now return to Mr. Alfred Oakly, and
learn how the world in the interim has fared with
him. Prosperity at the helm, his richly freighted
vessels careered over the wide ocean, no devastating
fires destroyed his dwellings, no whirlwinds up-rooted
his forests, no blight or mildew stole over his
fields to nip the golden harvest, and yet, with all
this, there was many a beggar who gleaned the refuse
from his kitchen, who knew more of happiness
than did this cold, selfish man. In the first place his
wife had never recovered from the shock to her
affections in being forced to yield up her unfortunate
child—not only her health but her temper suffered
severely. Toward her husband in particular
this change seemed pointed, and as much as she
had loved him previously her coldness was now
proportionate. Unhappily, too, for Louisa, the innocent
cause of this rupture, it extended itself even to
her, and thus childhood, that rainbow-tinted period
of life was to her clouded and joyless. Her father,
stern and morose, secluding her from playmates of
her own age—her mother seldom greeting her with
a word of affection or a smile of encouragement—her
caresses met by both with coldness, and all the
winning graces of childhood frowned down with
disfavor. Her education, however, went on as
though her frame were formed of iron. There was
a stiff governess, whose cold gray eye was ever on
her, to watch that she did not loll in sitting or stoop
in walking—that her toes turned out and her elbows
turned in—that she neither spoiled her mouth by
laughing (little danger!) nor her eyes by crying.
Then came the music-master with commands for
six hours daily practice for those little fingers—and
the dancing-master, saying “<span class='it'>Ma’amselle</span>, you must
be very gay—you cannot never learn de dance ven
you do look so vat you call fat-i-gued.” Then came
the drawing-master, and the professor of languages;
nor were these all to which her mind was tasked,
for besides, were those branches which her governess
professed to teach—her governess, Miss
Pinchem, with whom in comparison Miss Blimber
of Blimber Hall would have shrunk into insignificance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor little Louisa!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would sometimes wonder if the little children
she read of in the Bible had to learn all such things
to make them good—for Miss Pinchem was great
on goodness—always beginning and ending her exhortations
with, “Now, Miss Louisa, you must be
<span class='it'>good</span>, and not raise your eyes from your book”—“You
must play that tune with more scientific grace,
Miss Louisa, or you will not be <span class='it'>good</span>”—“You must
turn out your toes if you want to be <span class='it'>good</span>”—“You
will never be <span class='it'>good</span> if you don’t pronounce better”—in
short there was a great deal of goodness on Miss
Pinchem’s wiry tongue, let people say what they
would, and though Louisa wondered <span class='it'>what</span> made
<span class='it'>Miss Pinchem</span> good!</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had Mr. Oakly accomplished his object
in ridding his sight of the poor deformed, than he
would fain have held himself excused from all obligation
to the widow—but he dared not act out his
wishes, fearful in such case that she would claim
her own, and thus betray his disgraceful secret.
When he received Mrs. Oakly’s letter informing
him of her intended marriage, his apprehensions
were anew awakened. Could it be possible she
would keep the secret from her husband! Doubtless
she would scorn the imputation that so unsightly
a child as Agatha was her own offspring,
and thus to preserve her maternal pride forfeit her
word! O! a thorny pillow was that Mr. Oakly
nightly pressed! How often in his dreams did the
pale corse of his injured brother rise up before him,
and ever in its fleshless arms it bore the shrunken
form of Agatha! But as month after month rolled
on, swelling finally to years, and hearing nothing
further from the late Mrs. Oakly, he felt more at
ease, so much so that he entirely forgot her request
relative to the future advantage of his discarded
child! an oversight very natural to such a man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa reached her seventeenth year, and as the
bud gave promise so proved the flower, beautiful
indeed and lovely. Mr. Oakly was really proud of
this! He mentally contrasted her light elegant
figure with the <span class='it'>probable</span> appearance of Agatha, and
congratulated himself that he had not to bear about
the shame of acknowledging the latter! Still, he
did not <span class='it'>love</span> Louisa—strange that he almost hated
her for possessing those very attributes of loveliness
for which he had preferred her above his own offspring!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Louisa emerged from the seclusion of the
school-room to the brilliant circles of fashion, she
was caressed, flattered, adored. Wealth and beauty
tripping hand in hand seldom fail to win favor, and
brought a throng of admirers to the feet of the
heiress, who, however, did not seem easily moved;
and many were the suitors to her favor who met
with a kind but firm refusal. But, beware, Louisa,
your affections will be held by your tyrant father
just as much enslaved as your person; and now,
wo to you, should they centre where he does not
approve.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>Moonlight, golden, twinkling stars, fragrant zephyrs,
sweet from the lip of the lily, soft music from
tinkling leaves, a murmur from the rippling river,
and through the winding shrubbery, slowly along
the path tesselated by the moonbeams, which glint
through the leafy curtain, Louisa is straying—but
not alone. A youth is by her side, one whose arm
her own encircles, who clasps her willing hand in
his; one whose whispers are of love, and to whom
her own voice, gentle and low, speaks of hope and
happiness in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! foolish, foolish Louisa! what are you thinking
of? Only a poor painter—and <span class='it'>you</span> in love! True,
he has talent, worth, grace, refinement, but—<span class='it'>no
money</span>! And you, unfortunate youth, why did you
love this beautiful maiden? Know you not that man
of heartlessness and pride, her father, would gladly
crush you to the earth for lifting your eyes heaven-ward
to his daughter; that he would sooner buy
her winding-sheet than that she should don her
wedding-robe for <span class='it'>thee</span>! And yet, even now, closer
and closer are you both riveting the chain, drawing
heart to heart, which no hand but death can loose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the second summer after Louisa’s initiation
into the gay world that the Oakly family were once
more assembled at Oak Villa, their annual resort
during the warm months of July and August. With
no taste for reading, a mind not attuned for meditation,
and the querulousness of an <span class='it'>ungraceful</span> old
age gradually stealing upon him, Mr. Oakly found
the time drag most wearily on amid those quiet
groves. In his extremity an idea suddenly flashed
across his brain, which he eagerly caught at, as it
promised to relieve somewhat of that tedious vacuum
between those hours when such a man and
happiness may alone be said to look each other in
the face: viz., the hour of meals—and this was to
summon an artist to the villa, for the purpose of
decorating the walls of the saloon with the portraits
of its inmates. He had not thought of it before, but,
quite luckily, it now occurred to him that he already
had the address of a young artist in his pocket, for
whom some friend of struggling genius had solicited
patronage. Now he could kill two birds with one
stone, as it were, secure the plaudits of the world
by taking the artist by the hand in so flattering a
manner, and at the same time pull away the drag
from the wheels of time. He looked at the card—“Walter
Evertson,”—and to Walter Evertson did
he immediately address a letter, requesting his presence
at the villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came—a fine, handsome youth of three-and-twenty,
with an eye like an eagle, and hair dark as
a starless night—a dangerous companion, we must
allow, for the gentle Louisa. He was met with
condescending affability made most apparent by the
master of the house, and by Mrs. Oakly, who seldom
manifested much interest in any thing, with cool indifference.
No wonder, then, that he turned with a
thrill of pleasure tingling his heart-strings, to the
gentle Louisa, whose manners, at once so courteous
and refined, offered so agreeable a contrast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some, perhaps, whose hearts have
never yet felt the power of love, who rail about
love at first sight as a theory too ridiculous to dwell
upon—a chimera only originating in the heads of romantic
school-girls and beardless shop-boys; very
well, let them have it so; I only assert that both
Louisa and the artist, at that first interview, were
favorably impressed; and that a brief intercourse
under the same roof cemented their young hearts
with all the strength of a first and truthful affection.
Love (himself a sly artist) traced each on the other a
heart in fadeless tints. Sincere and unselfish was
the love which Walter Evertson had conceived for
Louisa; a love which he intended to bury within
his own throbbing breast—for he dared not flatter
himself that it would be returned—she, the heiress
of thousands—he, the poor, unfriended artist. Vain
resolve! It was the evening with which this chapter
commences, that, in an unguarded moment, he had
revealed to her his love, and received the blest
assurance of her own in return. But their cup of
joy was even then embittered by the consciousness
that her father, in his cold, selfish nature, would tear
their hearts asunder, even though he snapped their
life-strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime the business which had brought
him to the villa was being accomplished. Mr. and
Mrs. Oakly saw themselves to the life on canvas,
and now it only remained to consummate his work
by portraying the features of Louisa. Delightful,
yet difficult task! Mrs. Oakly had so far aroused
herself from her usual lethargy, as to insist that the
figure of Louisa herself should be but secondary in
the picture about to be executed. She was tired,
she said, of those stiff, prim figures on sombre-tinted
ground, looking out from gilded frames with eye-balls
ever coldly glaring upon one, and would have
a large painting of rare design and skill—woods,
fountains, birds, and flowers, to relieve the form
and face of Louisa from this dull sameness. Various
were the sketches brought forward for her approval;
and whole days, which Evertson wished might never
end, were spent in vain endeavors to settle upon
some one of them for the purpose. Accident, however,
at length furnished the desired <span class='it'>tableau</span>
although it would be doing injustice to Evertson to
imply that he lacked talent or originality—fine as
were his sketches, they failed to please Mrs. Oakly,
because—she would not be pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Louisa strolled out alone, and unconsciously
pursued her ramble until she reached
a beautiful meadow fringed with fine old trees,
whose branches bent down to meet their dark,
leafy shadows in the bright waters of the Susquehanna.
Birds were singing merrily, butterflies
sported their golden wings, and the grasshopper
chirped, blithely leaping through the tall grass.
Here and there, where the rays of the sun had
not yet penetrated, were the gossamers of elfin
broidery—mantles dropped by fairies on their merry
rounds in the checkered moonlight beneath those
old trees; there was a drop of bright nectar, too, left
in the cup of the wild-flower, and the large, red
clover-tops were sparkling with dew-gems. I cannot
assert that Louisa saw all the beauties of this fine
morning; for, absorbed in pleasing thoughts, upon
which we will not intrude, satisfied as we ought to
be that the artist occupied a full share, she seated
herself beneath one of those shadowing trees, and
resting her chin within the palm of her little hand,
most likely, I am sorry to say, heard neither the
warble of the birds, the cheerful chirping insect, or
saw the bright glancing river, with the little boat
which was just then dancing over its silver ripples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of voices approaching in the opposite
direction suddenly broke in upon her trance, and
she then, for the first time, reflected that she had
passed the boundaries of her father’s land. The
estate adjoining had lately been purchased by a
wealthy Englishman, it was said. For many weeks
repairs had been going on in the old mansion, which
for several years had been tenantless; and the family
were daily expected to arrive. That they had now
done so was Louisa’s conclusion. The voices drew
nearer; but, trusting to the thick foliage for concealment,
she remained perfectly still; when apparently
within but a few paces of her the party stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a lovely view!” exclaimed a soft female
voice. “I wish ma’ma had not turned back, she
would have been so delighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is truly fine,” was the reply, in a masculine
tone; “it is even more beautiful than the view from
the lawn we so much admired last evening; what
if you were to sketch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had only brought my crayons, I would do so
now. How lovely it is!” answered the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you have strength for it after your long walk,”
was the reply, “I will return for your portfolio;
here is a nice shady seat for you—I will soon be
back, but do not ramble away from this spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisa heard the retreating footsteps, and was
about to make good her own, when a beautiful
Scotch air, very sweetly warbled, arrested her attention.
The song ceased abruptly, giving place to a
scream so loud and shrill, as blanched the cheek of
Louisa with the hue of death. She sprang to her
feet, and panting with terror, emerged from her
shelter into the open meadow just as the scream
was again repeated. She now almost breathlessly
looked around to detect the cause of alarm. In a
moment she saw it all. A noble stag, having probably
leaped the park-pailings, came bounding
swiftly across the meadow directly toward the spot
where Louisa was now standing, no doubt with the
intention of slaking his thirst at the tempting stream.
The terrors of Louisa were at once allayed; and
she now hastened to the spot whence the screams
issued, to soothe, if possible, the fears of the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling with fright, and clinging to a tree for
support, was a female, dwarf-like in stature, and
deformed in shape. Her countenance was deadly
pale, and her eye-balls, almost fixed with terror,
were strained upon the animal, as he came leaping
onward. Ere Louisa could speak he had approached
within a few paces, and, as if now first aware of
their presence, he suddenly halted, arched his beautiful,
glossy neck, and bending his antlered head,
stood at bay. Seeing how utterly helpless was the
poor unknown, Louisa sprung forward, and telling
her not to be alarmed, quickly placed herself before
her; but the noble stag, as if disdaining to war with
women, after gazing upon them a few seconds with
his wild eyes, suddenly turned, and tossing his head
proudly, trotted off in another direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment how rejoiced was Louisa to see
her lover rapidly approaching—for the stranger had
already fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Water! water!” she cried, “quick, or she will die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without speaking, Evertson rushed to the river,
and filling his hat with its cooling waters, was in a
second at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor girl! she will die with terror, I fear. What
fine features, and what beautiful hair!” said Louisa,
as she swept back the long tresses from her neck
and brow, purer than alabaster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the object of their solicitude
opened her eyes. She could not speak, but pressing
the hand of Louisa to her lips, pointed toward a
mansion just discernible through a dense shrubbery
at some distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I bear you home?” inquired Evertson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger looked her thanks; and lifting her
in his arms as tenderly as if she were a babe, he proceeded
with his almost lifeless burthen in the direction
pointed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus met, for the first time, the discarded Agatha
and the innocent usurper of her rights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fancy of Walter Evertson seized at once
upon a scene so interesting as the one he had just
witnessed. No sooner did he part with Louisa at
the door of the saloon, than, hastening to his studio,
he began sketching the outlines of his truthful conceptions.
Rapidly did he hasten on his own misery—blissfully
unconscious the while of the sad termination
of his labors. Never had he wrought so well
and so rapidly—not a stroke but told. There was
the beautiful meadow, with its brave old trees, and
the river gleaming through their branches; the fine
stag, his antlered front bent toward the two females;
the graceful form of Louisa standing beneath the
old oak, shielding the terrified stranger, one arm
thrown around her, the other slightly raised as if
motioning the animal away. Love surely guided
his hand; for, without a sitting, the artist had transferred
from his heart to the canvas the gentle features
of Louisa with an accuracy undisputable. Strikingly,
too, had he delineated the form and face of the deformed—her
long, waving tresses—her pale countenance—her
large eyes fixed in terror upon the
stag, and her small, mis-shapen figure. Something,
too, had he caught, even in that short interview, of
the features of Agatha. He could not, however,
proceed in his task until it had received the approbation
of the master and mistress of the mansion.
He had purposely requested Louisa to be silent respecting
the morning’s adventure, that he might, by
surprise, obtain the mastery over the whims of Mrs.
Oakly, so hard to be gratified. They were now respectfully
invited to the picture-room, together with
Louisa, to pass judgment upon his (to him) beautiful
sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To depict the scene which followed the withdrawal
of the curtain he had placed before it would
be impossible. Mrs. Oakly gave one look, and with
a dreadful shriek, exclaiming, “<span class='it'>My child!</span>” fell
senseless to the floor. Mr. Oakly, foaming with
rage, his face livid and distorted, rushed upon the
astonished artist, and in a voice choked with passion,
cried,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of my house, villain! Ha! do you beard me
thus! Who are you, that have thus stolen my secret,
and dare to show me that picture—dare to place
that hateful image before me? Out of my house, I
say, ere I am tempted to commit a worse crime!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Astonished, bewildered, confounded, Evertson for
a moment could not speak, nor would the enraged
man hear him when he did. In vain Louisa, while
striving to restore animation to her mother, interceded,
explained, expostulated—alas! her tears and
agitation only betraying to her father a new source
of anger. Seizing her by the arm, and bidding her
seek her chamber, he thrust her from the room, and
then turning once more to the artist, as he raised
the still inanimate form of his wife,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you half an hour to make your arrangements
for leaving my roof—beware how you exceed
that time; when you are ready, you will find
the sum due you in this cursed room—begone, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without any attempt to see poor Louisa again,
and trusting he might be able to communicate with
her in a few days, Walter Evertson left the villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mr. Oakly next entered the painting-room
the money of the artist was still there—but the fatal
picture had disappeared.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>A few years after his marriage, Mr. Sullivan took
his family to Europe, where they remained until
within a few months previous to the singular meeting
of Louisa and Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a beautiful cottage on the borders of Loch
Katrine, their lives had been one uninterrupted
scene of happiness—always excepting the yearning
of a mother’s heart for her lost child. The education
of Ruth and Agatha had formed their chief care,
and was such as a kind-hearted, intelligent man like
Mr. Sullivan was proud to give them, sparing neither
money nor precept, and aided, too, by the superior
judgment and example of their excellent mother.
Ruth had grown up lovely and amiable, and at the
time the family returned to America, was affianced
to a fine young Scotchman. Poor Agatha had become
even more unsightly in figure, yet retained all
the simplicity and amiableness of her childhood.
Whatever may have been her own private feelings
upon her unfortunate deformity, it was rare, indeed,
that she ever made allusion to it. When she did,
it was with meekness and resignation to her Maker’s
will; for early in life had Agatha given herself to
Him whose love is more precious than all earthly
advantages. She seldom mixed with society, yet
when she did, even strangers, after a slight acquaintance,
thought no more of her unshapeliness. The
sweet expression of her countenance interested,
her intelligence charmed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Sullivan took possession of her new
residence on the Susquehanna, little did she dream
how short the distance which separated her from
her youngest born; and when Agatha related the
fright she had received during her morning ramble,
and spoke with such enthusiasm of the beautiful girl
who had so nobly come to her assistance, how little
did she think <span class='it'>whose</span> arms had encircled the trembling
Agatha, <span class='it'>whose</span> voice it was had tried to soothe her
fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sullivan avowed his determination of calling
immediately upon their neighbors to express his
thanks to the fair maid, and the gallant young gentleman
who had so opportunely come to the assistance
of dear Agatha, his pet and favorite. He did so the
next day, but he was too late—the house was
deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agatha evinced much regret at the circumstance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How sorry I am!” said she; “O, I do hope we
may hereafter meet again; the countenance of that
charming girl haunts me like a dream—so lovely,
and somehow so familiar to me—a stranger, sad yet
not a stranger. Sometimes, ma’ma, when you look
at me as you do now, I almost fancy her eyes are on
me; and then again, only for being a blonde, it appears
to me she greatly resembled dear Ruth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sullivan changed color, and evidently much
agitated, she inquired of her husband if he knew the
name of their late neighbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not,” was his reply, “and our servants are
as ignorant as ourselves. Ah! here comes an
honest lad with berries to sell—and a fine tempting
load, too. I will ask him while I purchase the fruit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boy measured out the berries, Mr. Sullivan
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my son, can you tell me who lives in the
fine old stone house just at the bend of the river?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oakly, sir—<span class='it'>Squire</span> Oakly we call him here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, quick, father, ma’ma is fainting!” screamed
Ruth, springing to her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment all was alarm and confusion; but
at length Mrs. Sullivan slowly opening her eyes desired
to be led to her chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will lie down a few moments—I shall soon be
better; it is nothing—nothing,” she answered to
their affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When alone, then did she give way to her joy.
What happiness! her dear Louisa—her long lost
was found. She was good, too, and lovely; her
kindness to a stranger proved the former, and the
assertions of the grateful Agatha the latter. She
might now hope by some fortunate chance to see
her—they might now meet. O, how could she keep
down her throbbing heart; how would she be able
to refrain from clasping her to her bosom, and avowing
herself her mother. When she thought she had
recovered sufficient composure, she again joined
the family; but it was almost as soon dissipated by
the conversation which followed her entrance into
the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Mr. Sullivan, “do you know
these foolish girls are for making out a relationship
between themselves and our runaway neighbors—claiming
a cousinship, even if several degrees removed,
to the fair heroine of Agatha’s story—can it
be so, think you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Mr. Oakly may possibly have been some
connection of their father’s,” faltered Mrs. Sullivan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had papa no brothers?” said Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, one; but some unhappy family disagreement,
however, prevented any intercourse. They were
as strangers to each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if this Mr. Oakly should prove our uncle.
Had he any family, ma’ma?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe—one—one daughter,” was the almost
inaudible reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not say any more,” whispered Agatha to
her sister, “don’t you see how it distresses ma’ma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sullivan had observed the same thing, and
the subject was dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few days the papers announced among the
list of passengers sailed for Havre, the name of Mr.
Alfred Oakly, lady and daughter.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Another flight of years, and behold what changes
in the fortunes of Mr. Oakly. Adversity had at last
seized its victim, gorging to the full its revenge for
those years when its existence had been but as a
phantom to the wealthy merchant; he now felt its
iron clutches to be something more tangible than
shadows. The sea had swallowed his vessels;
flames had greedily swept over his warehouses;
blight had devastated his fields; failures of firms he
considered as good as the bank—nay, even the bank
itself failed; and in the short space of one year, Mr.
Oakly found himself stripped of all save a mere
pittance, which, with the most scrupulous economy,
could hardly support his family. The teachings of
adversity upon the cold, selfish heart, are sometimes
blessed with happy fruits. And thus it proved with
Mr. Oakly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>True, the change was not instantaneous; he lost
not his property to-day, to become a Christian, a
philosopher to-morrow. But as a drop of water
will in time wear away the hardest rock, so, little
by little, were the flinty feelings of his heart softened
and purified. The wicked and selfish deeds of his
past life arose up before him, each with its own
accusing tongue. That fortune, for which he had
risked his soul, had crumbled away, but these stood
out plain and distinct, only to be effaced through the
mercies of One whose most sacred obligations he
had violated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Oakly met this reverse of fortune humbly
and uncomplainingly. Happily, she was ignorant
of the sin of her husband, in having, like a second
Cain, destroyed his brother. Yet she felt that for
another crime—<span class='it'>the disowning of his own offspring</span>—the
punishment was just. Her own conscience, too,
reproached her for the unjust feelings in which she
had indulged toward the innocent Louisa; and now,
almost for the first time in her life, she treated her
as a daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kind, gentle, affectionate Louisa! only that she
saw her parents deprived of many comforts which
would have soothed their declining years, she would
have rejoiced in a change of fortune which had
brought with it their love. In her heart there was
a secret sorrow which she might breathe to none—it
was her love for Walter Evertson. Never, since
that fatal day, had she seen or heard again from him;
but that he was faithful, and would be faithful unto
death, her trusting heart assured her. When ease
and affluence surrounded her, this sudden separation
from her lover, and under such afflicting and
inexplicable circumstances, had seemed to paralyze
her energies. Books, music, travel, all failed to
excite more than mere mechanical attention; but
now, in the sorrows of her parents, she lost the
selfishness of her own, and strove in every way to
comfort them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What now had become of the once proud merchant?
His name was no longer heard on ’change,
unless coupled with a creditor’s anathema; and
summer friends, like the sun on a rainy day, were
behind the cloud.</p>

<hr class='tbk121'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cold, cheerless day in December; one of
those days when one hugs close to the fire-side, and
when even a glance at the dull, sombrous out-of-door
atmosphere makes, or ought to make, one thankful
for the blessings of a pleasant fire, to say nothing of
the society of a friend, or the solace of a book.
With all these comforts combined, the family of Mr.
Sullivan had assembled in the breakfast parlor.
There was the grate, heaped to the topmost bar of
the polished steel, with glowing anthracite; the soft
carpet of warm and gorgeous hues; luxuriant plants
of foreign climes, half hiding the cages of various
little songsters, whose merry notes breathed of
spring-time and shady groves; and the face of grim
winter shut out by rich, silken folds of crimson
drapery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pleasant morning meal was already passed,
and the breakfast things removed, with the exception
of the beautiful coffee-set of Sevre’s china,
which Mrs. Sullivan was so old-fashioned as to take
charge of herself; in preference to trusting it with
servants. Seated at the head of the table, a snowy
napkin in her hand, she was now engaged in this
domestic office. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Danvers
(the husband of Ruth) had just gone into the study,
to talk over some business affairs. Ruth had taken
the morning paper, and upon a low ottoman by the
side of her mother, was reading the news of the
day—now to herself, or, as she found a paragraph
of peculiar interest, aloud for the general entertainment.
Agatha was reclining upon the sofa, and
nestling by her side was a beautiful boy of two
years old, playing bo-peep through the long, sunny
curls of “Aunt Gatty,” his merry little shouts, and
infantile prattle, quite overpowering ma’ma’s news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why what can this mean?” suddenly exclaimed
Ruth; “do hear this, ma’ma. ‘If the former widow
of Mr. John Oakly (the name of her present husband
unknown) be still living, or the children of said John
Oakly, they are requested to call at No. 18 ——
street, and inquire for A. O., or to forward a note to
the same address, stating where they may be found.’
What can it mean, ma’ma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without answering, Mrs. Sullivan rose from her
chair; she trembled in every limb, and her countenance
was deadly pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ruth, dearest,” said she, “ring the bell, and
order the carriage immediately to the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ma’ma, you surely will not go out alone,” said
Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, alone! do not disturb your father,” answered
Mrs. Sullivan; “alone must I meet this
trial. My dear girls,” she continued, “ask me no
questions. God knows what I am about to learn,
whether tidings of joy or sorrow; but I trust all
may be explained when I return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the carriage was at the door,
and tenderly embracing Ruth and Agatha, she departed
upon her anxious errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After passing through so many streets that it
seemed they must have nearly cleared the city, the
carriage turned into a narrow street, or rather lane,
and stopped at No. 18, a small two story wooden
building. Mrs. Sullivan alighted and rang the bell.
The door was opened by a little servant-girl, to
whom she handed a card, on which she had written
with a trembling hand, “A person wishes to speak
with A. O.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the girl returned and ushered
her up stairs into a small parlor. Her fortitude
now nearly forsook her, and it was with difficulty
she could support herself to a chair. As soon as
she could command herself she looked around to
see if she could detect aught which might speak to
her of her child. Upon the table on which she
leaned were books. She took up one, and turned
to the title-page; in a pretty Italian hand was traced
“Louisa Oakly.” Several beautiful drawings also attracted
her eye—they, too, bore the name of “Louisa
Oakly.” But before she had time to indulge in the
blissful hopes this caused her, the door opened, and
Mr. Oakly, with an agitation nearly equal to her
own, entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many years had flown since they met, and time
on both had laid his withering hand; but while Mrs.
Sullivan presented all the beautiful traits of a
peaceful, happy decline into the vale of years, the
countenance of Mr. Oakly was furrowed and haggard
with remorse, and all those evil passions which had
formerly ruled his reason. Quickly advancing, he
extended his hand, and attempted to speak, but
emotion checked all utterance, while the big tears
slowly rolled down his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, speak—speak! tell me—Louisa!” cried Mrs.
Sullivan, alarmed at his agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Compose yourself,” replied Mr. Oakly, “Louisa
is well. I have sought this interview, that I may
make all the reparation now left me for my injustice
and cruelty. You see before you, madam, a miserable
man, haunted by remorse, and vain regrets
for past misdeeds. From my once proud and lofty
standing,” he continued, glancing around the apartment,
“I am reduced to this. Yet think not I repine
for the loss of riches. No! were millions now at my
command, I would barter all for a clear, unaccusing
conscience. Wealth, based on fraud, on uncharitableness,
must sooner or later come to ruin. I once
despised poverty, and cherished a haughty spirit
toward those I arrogantly deemed my inferiors.
Have I not my reward!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my child—tell me of my child!” interrupted
Mrs. Sullivan, scarce heeding his remarks, “where
is she? May I not see her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bear with me a little while longer,” said Mr.
Oakly, “in half an hour she shall be yours forever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, I thank thee!” exclaimed Mrs. Sullivan,
bursting into tears of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I yield her to your arms,” continued Mr.
Oakly, “the loveliest daughter that ever blessed a
mother, and relieve you forever from the charge of
an unfortunate, to whom my conduct has been both
brutal and unnatural. Listen to me, madam, for a
few moments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then as briefly as possible made confession of
the base part he had acted toward his brother, and
the means employed to ruin him with his father;
the selfish motives which led to the exchange of
the children; related the incident of the picture, and
consequent removal from Oak Villa—for well did
he divine <span class='it'>who</span> the deformed was. He then spoke
of Louisa; of her uniform loveliness of character,
and the gentleness with which she had borne, as he
acknowledged, his oft repeated unkindness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She knows all,” said he in conclusion, “and
waits even now to receive a mother’s embrace. I
will send her to you, and may her tears and caresses
plead my forgiveness!” So saying, Mr. Oakly quickly
withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment—an age to Mrs. Sullivan—the door
gently unclosed and mother and child were folded
in each <a id='oth'></a>other’s arms!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are feelings which no language can convey—and
which to attempt to paint would seem
almost a sacrilege!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a short time Mr. Oakly re-entered, accompanied
by his wife. The meeting between the mothers
was painful—for each felt there was still another
trial for them! Mrs. Oakly now really loved Louisa,
and that Mrs. Sullivan was most fondly attached to
poor Agatha the reader already knows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O she has been a solace and a comfort to me!”
said she to Mrs. Oakly. “A more noble-minded—a
more unselfish, pure being never lived than our
dear Agatha! believe me, to part from her will cause
a pang nearly as great as when I first gave my
darling Louisa to your arms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another hour was spent in free communion, and
then tenderly embracing her new found daughter,
the happy mother returned home—the events of the
morning seeming almost too blissful to be real!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was sometime ere she could command herself
sufficiently to the task before her. At length summoning
all her resolution she made known to her
astonished husband and Ruth the strange secret she
had so long buried in her breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Sullivan undertook to break the intelligence
to Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Agatha was very much overcome, and for
several hours her distress was such as made them
almost tremble for her reason. Although the circumstances
were related in the most guarded and
delicate manner, nor even a hint given as to the
motives of an act so unnatural as her father had
been guilty of toward her—her sensitive mind too
well divined the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet how can I blame them,” said she, glancing
in a mirror as she spoke, “who could love such a
being! Ah forgive me,” she cried, throwing her
arms around the neck of Mrs. Sullivan, who now
joined them—“forgive me—<span class='it'>you</span>—<span class='it'>you</span> received me—my
best, my dearest, my only mother—<span class='it'>you</span> took
the little outcast to your arms—<span class='it'>you</span> could love even
the mis-shapen child whom others loathed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sullivan strove by the most gentle caresses
to sooth her agitation, and at length succeeded so
far that Agatha listened calmly to all she had to say,
and expressed her desire to be guided by her in
every thing relating to this (to her) painful disclosure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost in a fainting state was Agatha given to
her mother’s arms, and at sight of her father she
shuddered and buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O the pang that went to the soul of her wretched
father as he witnessed this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agatha, my <span class='it'>child</span>, will you not then look upon
me! will you not say you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She extended her hand wet with tears:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I have nothing to pardon. I am not now
less hideous in form than when to look upon me
caused you shame and sorrow. In giving me to
my dearest aunt you gave me every blessing, every
happiness, this world has for me—but do not, O do
not now tear me from!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God! I am rightly punished!” exclaimed Mr.
Oakly—“my own child in turn disowns me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agatha,” said Mrs. Oakly, “will you not love
<span class='it'>me</span>—love your mother, Agatha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agatha hesitated, and her beautiful eyes streamed
with tears—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mother!</span> I can give that name to but <span class='it'>one</span>!—<span class='it'>here—here</span>
is my <span class='it'>mother</span>!” turning and throwing her
arms around the neck of Mrs. Sullivan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not so was it with Louisa. Like a dove long
panting for its rest, she had at last reached that
haven of love—a mother’s heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed so much distress did the thought of being
separated from her more than mother cause poor
Agatha, that, fearful for her health, Mr. and Mrs.
Sullivan prevailed upon her parents to take up
their residence with them for a few months, to
which request they finally acceded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after her first interview with Mr. Oakly,
Mrs. Sullivan presented him with a deed of the cottage,
which so many years before he had given her,
little dreaming that any reverse of fortune would
ever make <span class='it'>him</span> grateful for so humble a shelter!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rent,” said she, “has been regularly paid
into the hands of a faithful person, who also holds
in trust the remittances which you from time to
time forwarded me. I placed them there for the
benefit of Agatha, should she survive me. It came
from you originally—it is again your own—then
hesitate not to receive it from my hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent, noble woman!” exclaimed Mr. Oakly,
overwhelmed with emotion, “how little have I
merited this kindness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, together with principal and interest, what
at first was but a trifling sum, had in the course of
eighteen or twenty years amounted to quite a little
fortune. It was now settled that as soon as the
Spring opened Mr. and Mrs. Oakly were to take
possession of the little cottage, and rather than be
separated from their dear Agatha, the Sullivans
were soon to follow and take lodgings for the summer
months.</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear madam,” says the reader, “you
have entirely forgotten to tell us what became of
the unfortunate artist, the lover of Louisa, whom
you appear to think happy enough in her present
situation <span class='it'>without</span> a lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O no, dear reader—but this is not a love-story,
you know—if it were I would tell you the particulars
of a most interesting love scene between
Walter Evertson and his adored Louisa. Suffice it
to say, they were married, and that the picture
which caused their unhappy separation occupies a
conspicuous place in their beautiful villa, a few
miles from the city of P——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>During</span> my childhood my mother carried me every
year, toward the close of autumn, to spend a month
with one of my aunts. It has been a long while
since then, but, nevertheless, the memory of my
sojourn with her appears as vivid as the events of
yesterday, and I fancy myself once more in her
handsome château, which was situated on the right
branch of the river Meuse, at the place where the
stream, still far from its mouth, has not attained its
greatest width, and where it is bordered with rugged
rocks and precipitous steeps, which remind one of
many portions of Switzerland, and of the delicious
banks of the Rhine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To linger near a beloved sister was a great pleasure
to my mother; she had arrived, too, at that
age when the glories of nature produce the deepest
impression, and enjoyed with enthusiasm the exquisite
landscape unrolled before our eyes. As to
myself, I dwelt but little on the picturesque charms
of the country. I was too young for the inhabitants
of the château to interest themselves much concerning
my amusements, and left to follow my own will,
I discovered sources of happiness which I tested
with all the eager vivacity of a child. First I found
an orchard filled with young fruit, which, though
still indifferent, I gladly availed myself of; then in
the mountain I claimed a grotto, whose entrance I
closed with boughs of trees, and pompously styled
it my house; and lastly, I delighted in a gallery that
was narrow and dimly lighted, and hung on both
sides with old family portraits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw there, warlike men, clothed in complete
armor, the hand clenched, the head held high and
proudly; others, habited in black, wearing immense
ruffs, and having their hair braided, and their beards
cut in a point; and others were handsome gentlemen,
with coats of embroidered velvet, and <span class='it'>coiffés</span>,
with enormous wigs, which covered even their
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladies there were yet more numerous. Some
of them wore their hair in small curls, and long
robes bordered with fur; others had hoops, and
powdered heads, laden with plumes, pearls, and
flowers, carrying in their hands an immense rose,
or a very small bird. Several were in fancy costumes;
there were Dianas, the quiver on their
shoulders, the crescent on their brows; Floras, in
white satin, sprinkled with blossoms; and shepherdesses,
with a crook, and tiny hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I passed in this gallery every moment I could
steal from my lessons and my mother. I glided
there unperceived, and remained until I imagined
all those figures, their eyes fixed on mine, seemed
to move from their frames; sometimes I thought
their features grew more stern, their smiles more
scornful—and I would depart hastily, in fear and
trembling, with the firm resolution to return no more.
But what is it at last—the firm resolution of a little
girl. By the next day I had forgotten the terrors of
the preceding one, and found myself again in the
gallery, feverish with emotion, and drawn by some
powerful attraction I could not resist, to gaze on
those old pictures I had so often contemplated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among these paintings, the one that I loved the
best, that I always sought for, and that never frightened
me, was the portrait of a youthful woman,
dressed in a black robe. The sleeves were looped
with agrafes, inlaid with pearls, leaving uncovered
the loveliest arm in the world, and long, fair hair,
entirely unadorned, flowed in large waves on her
shoulders. With her large, blue eyes, her peculiarly
regular features, and singularly gentle expression,
her beauty would have been faultless, but for the
frightful paleness which spread itself over her countenance.
She was as white as the column of
marble against which her brow was pictured as
leaning; and I have frequently thought since, that
there was, perhaps, something of coquetry in this
posture. The melancholy face of the young lady,
contrasted with the smiling visages of the dames
who surrounded her, and this strange sadness,
combined with the languid grace of her position,
exercised over my mind a sort of inexplicable fascination.
In my childish admiration, I asked myself
if a being so beautiful had ever really existed. The
impression produced by her haunted me every
where; and I remembered it even in my dreams.
One day, which had been appointed for a visit in
the neighborhood, I contrived to escape, for the purpose
of seeing again my cherished favorites, before
leaving them for several hours. I had intended
remaining with them but a moment; and I flattered
myself my absence would be unperceived by the
family. But gradually I forgot the anticipated trip,
the pleasure awaiting me, my aunt, my mother, in
fact, every thing, and lingered, as if chained to my
stand, with eyes fixed rapturously on the Pale Lady,
(it was thus I designated her,) and blending her
image with the wildest adventures my youthful
imagination could conceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already I had been called twenty times, and the
domestics were sent to search for me; but my abstraction
was so profound, that I was insensible to
all, and still lingered motionless before the portrait,
when my aunt opened the door, and surprised me
in the gallery. My lengthened absence had begun
to occasion alarm, and the frightened manner of my
aunt recalled suddenly my wandering thoughts.
Perhaps conscious of my fault, or it may be, ashamed
of being thus entrapped, I threw myself into my
aunt’s arms, and a few tears moistened my cheeks.
The reprimand died upon her lips, but yielding to
the astonishment inspired by my intense admiration
for these old pictures, she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, you are beholding a woman who has
been very beautiful, and very unhappy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very unhappy!” I had then imagined rightly.
“Dear aunt, will you relate to me her history!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this morning, they are waiting for us; and
beside, you are yet too young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too young to hear her history? Ah! how unfortunate
that is! But never mind, by our next
visit I shall be twelve years of age, then I will be
tall—promise I may hear it then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She granted the wished for promise, and a few
days afterward we quitted the château.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following year we repaired, as usual, to my
aunt’s, and had scarcely exchanged the greeting
caresses, before, longing to satisfy my impatient
curiosity, I seized my aunt’s hand with an air of
gravity whose cause she did not comprehend. I
conducted her to the gallery, and pausing before
my favorite picture, “Good aunt,” I said, “now is
the time to fulfill your promise!” She regarded me,
surprised and smiling, and deferred only until that
evening the recital of the history so much desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Orders were issued to prepare the gallery for our
reception, and in the presence of the portrait of
Wilhelmine de Cernan, I learned the strange misfortunes
of her life. They appeared to me so interesting
that I have since endeavored to find further
details to fill the deficiency of my memory; and it is
her history which, in my turn, I am about to relate
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine de Cernan, reared by her mother in
the country, had grown to girlhood in the seclusion
of her own family, and the intimacy of a few
cherished friends. Her simple tastes prompted her
to love retirement, and her disposition, naturally a
melancholy one, shrunk timidly from much which
usually makes the happiness of women. The pleasures
of society, those gay balls and animated assemblies
youth is prone to love so intensely, had for her
no attractions. Her mother, by whom she was idolized,
never imagined that this tendency of character
could injure her daughter; she therefore never
sought to subdue it, and only throve to inculcate
those doctrines of piety which had formed the basis
of her own education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Religion appeared to the spirit of Wilhelmine robed
with all its noblest and sublimest coloring; and its
mystical beauty tinged for her the most trivial details
of life. She seemed almost like an angel, who
claimed communion every day, every moment,
with heaven. God and her mother! in these two
thoughts lay all her existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had attained the age of eighteen, the
Baron de Breuil was presented to her as a desirable
connection, and scarcely pausing to interrogate her
heart as to the nature of her sentiments, she tranquilly
accepted his hand, confident that she could
repose on her mother the care of her happiness.
Wilhelmine could not, in truth, have made a selection
more worthy of her, for M. de Breuil was in
all respects a good and estimable man. His château
was but a league distant from the residence of
Madame de Cernan; the mother and daughter met
daily, and nothing was changed for Wilhelmine.
The baron believed himself the most fortunate of
men, and was unceasingly occupied in cultivating
the powers of his young wife. He lavished all his
care to adorn her intellect, to direct her talents, and
to elevate her mind to the appreciation of whatever
is truly grand and beautiful. One portion of their
time was dedicated to reading, another to drawing,
a third to music and exercise; and they never concluded
a day without a visit to some poor dwelling,
where their presence carried consolation and benefit.
In the midst of these peaceful employments and
pure pleasures, the life of Wilhelmine glided tranquilly
on. The spectacle of crime had never saddened
her eyes; and misery had appeared to her
only to be relieved. It seemed as if an existence so
uniform, so gentle, should have lasted long; but He
whose will is not as our will, had ordained otherwise.
At the end of two years of happiness, the
Baron de Breuil was attacked by violent illness, and
the physicians soon declared his life was in imminent
danger. Wilhelmine, bathed in tears, never
quitted the bedside of her husband, but, unable to
conceal the agony of her grief, she lavished upon
him all the attentions of the truest tenderness. Himself
resigned to death, but profoundly grieved by the
deep affliction of his wife, he endeavored to console
her by the most comforting expressions; but Wilhelmine,
overcome by anguish, would listen to nothing
he could say. She sunk at length into a state of
torpor, from which she could scarcely be aroused,
even by her desire to attend on the invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God is merciful!” at last said M. de Breuil to her,
“he will sustain you in your misfortune, he will
enable you once more to find charms in existence.
You are young; the future proffers you bright days;
the prospect of life before you is calm and smiling.
Alas! I fondly hoped we might have trodden its
pathway together; but Heaven has ordained otherwise.
Perhaps another—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” exclaimed Wilhelmine, “never! <span class='it'>I</span> love
another after loving you! <span class='it'>I</span> unite my lot with another’s!
<span class='it'>I</span> forget you! Ah! rather would I die a
thousand times!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wilhelmine! Wilhelmine! grief at this time distracts
you, but remember, nothing here is eternal,
not even an affection as pure is ours. Believe a
man who has had much experience; your heart
will feel the ‘strong necessity of loving.’ Happy
will he be who fulfills that want! May he be worthy
of that enjoyment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine covered her husband’s hands with
kisses; she seemed almost indignant at being thus
misunderstood, thus illy judged; she repulsed these
mournful predictions; but the dying one drew her
gently toward him, “My love, life departs, the last
moment approaches. Here, take back this ring, I
release thee from all thy promises!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! have pity on me! retain this ring, and if
ever your fatal prophecies should be realised; if
ever I bestow on another the affection you should
bear with you, unbroken in the tomb, it is from yourself
I will demand the right; it is in your grave I
will seek this ring; it is from your finger I will dare
to take it! <span class='it'>Most solemnly I swear it!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wilhelmine! no impious words—no rash oaths!”
The baron pronounced these words with difficulty—and
they were his last. He revived only to fall
into renewed paroxysms, and after a few hours,
expired in the arms of his despairing wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine sincerely mourned for the man who
had acquired so many claims on her gratitude.
During a long period the young widow remained
shut up in her château, surrounding herself with all
objects calculated to recall her past felicity, and
seeming to revel in her sorrow, by refusing every
means by which it might have been alleviated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of three years, an event obliged her
to leave this solitude. Madame de Cernan fell
dangerously ill. Wilhelmine, terrified by the peril
of her mother, forgot her grief, and made preparations
for immediate departure. A celebrated physician
resided at Brussels, and it was decided they
should travel to that city. The tenderness of a
daughter is sometimes as inexhaustible as that of a
mother; and only those who have seen their parents
on the brink of the grave, who have experienced
the agony of their loss, can comprehend the profundity
of filial love. Wilhelmine dreaded the moment
when she might read in the physician’s eyes,
the sentence of life or death for her mother; and at
length that moment, so feared while it was desired,
arrived. The doctor reassured her concerning the
illness of Madame de Cernan; but her convalescence,
he said, must be tedious, and they must not
think of removing their residence for several
months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine was for some time faithful to her preconceived
plan of living alone with her mother.
She could not, however, refuse forming a few
acquaintances. Madame de Cernan had met with
one of her early friends; and the <span class='it'>sauvagerie</span> of the
young widow was not proof against the pressing
solicitations of this lady. She consented at first to
see her unceremoniously, then accepted invitations
to her <span class='it'>soirées</span>, and finally avowed she found them
exceedingly entertaining. In truth, the very best
society was to be found in the saloons of the Comtesse
D’A——, for they united all that Belgium contained
of the lovely and the intellectual. Among the gentlemen,
the nephew of Madame D’A——, Edmond de
Gaser, was distinguished by the beauty of his person,
the original tone of his mind, and the uncommon
variety of his acquirements. Among the ladies,
Wilhelmine soon occupied a prominent station;
and her gentleness and reserve prevented the
jealousy her loveliness and talent were calculated
to awaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a continual contest as to who could
most surround her with homage, who bestow the
most flattering tokens of friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edmond de Gaser speedily became very devoted
to Madame de Breuil, and, indeed, this conquest
could not have failed to gratify the vanity of any
woman less destitute of <span class='it'>coquetterie</span>—for Edmond
had been reared with strict principles; his few
years of life had already been shadowed by trouble,
and he had acquired by severe and philosophic
studies a judgment of rare solidity. Edmond combined
with the advantages of rank and fortune,
those qualities of mind which, in all social communities,
elevate a man above those otherwise
his equals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine never dreamed of incurring danger
in encouraging the sentiments of benevolence and
interest inspired by M. de Gaser. Knowing nothing
of what is commonly called love, except through
the medium of a few novels, she imagined the
dawnings of passion were attended by the violent
and peculiar emotions of which she had read such
false portraitures; and she calculated on defence
from these in the purity of her own heart. This
dangerous security proved fatal to her peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she at length perceived the nature of her
sentiments, it was too late to subdue them—for she
loved M. de Gaser with all the devotedness of an
ardent nature, and a vivid imagination; remorse
even added depth to her affection. Since the moment
she had comprehended that her feeling for
Edmond was neither esteem nor friendship, but a
more absorbing attachment, the recollection of her
husband arose in her heart with all the impetuosity
of an appealing conscience. She would have taken
refuge in flight, but winter was at its height, and
she dared not cause her mother to undertake at
that time, a journey whose consequences would
have been fatal to her health. Every thing was
in opposition to poor Wilhelmine; the representations
of her mother, who treated the griefs which
engrossed her as mere idle scruples; the opinion
of the world, which might have served to authorise
in her own eyes a second marriage; and, more than
all, the constant presence of Edmond—for had she
ceased to see him, it would have seemed a tacit
confession of weakness. The tears she almost continually
shed, destroyed her health; and when, on
the arrival of spring, they prepared to leave Brussels,
it was not for Madame de Cernan, but for Wilhelmine,
the journey offered dangers, so completely
had she been, in a short time, exhausted by grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the day for their departure was
fixed. Wishing to avoid a final interview with
M. de Gaser, she denied herself to visitors; but
Edmond, charmed at the thought of Wilhelmine’s
no longer suffering, entered by a different door, and
penetrated into the garden of the hotel. He stood
fixedly regarding the windows which he supposed
were those of Madame de Breuil’s apartment, when
suddenly, in a turn of the path, he perceived her
walking slowly, her eyes bent on the ground, like a
person giving way to most profound abstraction.
The exclamation uttered by Edmond on recognising
her, aroused her from her reverie. Wilhelmine
being no longer able to control her emotion, Edmond
realised that he was beloved; and this belief lent
him courage to declare a tenderness which had
until now been only told by his looks. Troubled
and irresolute, Wilhelmine seemed not to hear him,
but, nevertheless, every word re-echoed through
her heart. At last, with that impetuosity of determination
which sometimes succeeds to prolonged
uncertainty, she answered, “In six months I will be
your wife!” and then hastily quitted him, leaving
M. de Gaser intoxicated with happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Madame de Cernan and her
daughter were on their homeward way. The
nearer Wilhelmine approached the places she had
frequented with M. de Breuil, the sadder became
her thoughts. When the sombre turrets of the
castle became visible, enveloped in the morning
clouds, a torrent of tears flowed from Wilhelmine’s
eyes. “Never! never!” she passionately exclaimed,
and threw herself in the arms of her mother. Madame
de Cernan did not endeavor to repress the
emotions which the aspect of these places was calculated
to call forth in the refined mind of her daughter;
she waited patiently until time should familiarize
her to these memories; but the time which calmed
the paroxysms of sorrow, also restored all her incertitudes.
No longer to love Edmond, seemed a
sacrifice beyond her strength; and would he not,
then, have the right to reproach her with the loss of
the happiness she had promised him? Unfortunate
woman! she should have concealed her love; then,
at least, she would have suffered alone. There
were even moments when Wilhelmine wished to
go and reclaim her marriage-ring; when she would
revel in all the horror inspired by the thought, and
encourage it in a spirit of penitence; again, she
would repel it with fright and indignation; but,
nevertheless, this idea pursued her incessantly, and
even in her sleep she heard a voice murmur to her,
“Go, seek thy ring in the tomb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Breuil consulted the venerable priest
who had always instructed and guided her. Under
the sacred seal of confession she implored his
counsel; prostrate at his feet, she entreated him to
decide her destiny. Never had the confessor directed
a penitent in a case so difficult; he paused for many
moments, and seemed unwilling to pronounce—but
the young widow insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” at last said the minister of truth,
“it has been said, ‘Thou shalt not swear!’ and you
have failed to follow this command; you have disobeyed
God—you ought to submit to the consequence
of your fault. It has been before Heaven;
beside a dying bed you have pronounced a terrible
vow—this vow you must fulfill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, mercy! mercy!” cried the penitent</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my daughter, I but repeat the words spoken
to you by the voice of conscience; I only say to you
what you say each day to yourself. Either renounce
Edmond, or demand from the dead your marriage-ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father!” replied Wilhelmine, trembling and
overwhelmed, “my father, to renounce Edmond is
impossible, I love him a thousand times more than
myself; he is dearer even than M. de Breuil, whom
I loved so well. In mercy, curse me not! for all
will be expiated to-day. You decree that I should
descend into our family vault. I will go. You tell
me to touch the hand of a skeleton. I will touch it.
You order me to ask from the dead the ring which
alone can unite me to Edmond. Well, I will ask it,
even if I must die in the sad place I go to sully with
my presence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worthy confessor, alarmed by this tone of
excitement, sought to calm her, and recommended
the deferring until a future period an undertaking
so solemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! it is this very hour I must perform the
deed; but my mother knows nothing of it. My poor
mother! she would never consent to her child’s
passing through such an ordeal. One person only
must accompany me in this mournful visit, and
he is the man who knew the secret, the man
who advised it—yourself! Will you consent to
follow me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The venerable priest, surprised by a resolution
so sudden, surprised, above all, by the change which
had come over the mind and language of Wilhelmine,
could not resist the impetuosity of his penitent,
and yielded, in opposition to his better judgment,
to the ascendency of a strong and overbearing will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will follow you!” was his reply. He silently
selected the key of the vault, where lay the remains
of the members of the family of Breuil, he lighted a
torch, and advanced toward the chapel, beneath
which the tomb was situated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame!” he said impressively to Wilhelmine,
“this is the moment to have courage. The action
you are about to commit is a solemn one, but it
should not dismay you. You are fulfilling a sacred
promise, you are acquitting yourself of a painful
duty. God approves it, you have nothing to fear;”
and taking her hand, they descended together the
stairs that no step had trodden since the death of
the baron. They entered the vault. Wilhelmine
concentrated all her energy; she advanced, still
guided by the priest. He lifted the stone which
covered the tomb, and removed every obstacle.
Wilhelmine, with averted eyes, put forth her hand;
she wished to accomplish her vow without contemplating
the hideous spectacle before her—but the
ring must be grasped. She looks, and a cry of
astonishment burst from her lips. She had expected
to behold remains disfigured, and perhaps not recognizable;
but she sees her husband, such as he
ever was during the happy days they <a id='pass'></a>passed together;
his countenance still retained its expression of goodness
and tenderness. It was still M. de Breuil, the
husband so well-beloved; doubtless he reposed, he
only slept. Alas! soon he may awaken, to ask an
account of the fidelity which should have been
eternal; he may speak to her in threatening words;
he may crush her with scorn, on learning the cause
of this, her first visit. Such were the thoughts that
startled the young widow, as she gazed on her husband’s
form. She had not strength to bear such a
scene, and striving to support herself on her companion’s
arm, she faltered, tottered, and fell lifeless.
The priest, fearing this pure spirit had departed to
rejoin that of the dead, carried the young widow to
her apartment, and informed her mother of the cause
of this terrible shock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine recovered her consciousness, only to
sink into the most alarming delirium. A burning
fever attacked her, and during several days her
death was momentarily expected. But at last her
youth triumphed over this crisis, she recovered her
health, and at the end of two months had regained
sufficient strength to walk a few steps in her chamber.
She passed before a mirror, and accidentally
glanced at its image of herself; what was her
amazement at beholding a face whiter than alabaster
itself. She tried to close her eyes, but could
not cease regarding it. It was herself, these were
indeed her features, but could illness have produced
a change so sudden and mysterious? Alas! this
paleness never departed more!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her former intentions were irrevocably arrested,
she resolved not to see Edmond again, and the
prayers of her lover and her mother were equally
unavailing. She consecrated herself solely to good
works, and to those exercises of piety and benevolence
which her too exclusive affection for M. de
Gaser had for a time interrupted. She lived the
life of a saint, shedding blessings around her, and
endeavoring to procure for others the happiness she
could no longer obtain for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilhelmine’s appearance continued as she had
seen it the first day of her convalescence. She had
now forsaken the world, and the world speedily
forgot her; but a small number of friends ceased
not to offer her pity and consolation. While still
young, she was attacked by a disease of languor,
which left no room for hope, and ere long Wilhelmine
had reached her last hour. A few moments
before her death she bade a touching farewell to
all her friends, and turning to Madame de Cernan,
she said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother, relate to them the particulars of
my history; tell them to beware of making rash
vows; it is a vow which has killed me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My aunt shed tears as she concluded this recital,
and I wept bitterly over the mournful destiny of the
pale lady. After the day I learned this mournful
chronicle, I evinced as much solicitude to avoid
finding myself in the vicinity of the portrait gallery
as I had hitherto displayed anxiety to visit its attractions.
I could not pass before her picture without
my heart beating quicker at the remembrance of
the sorrows of Wilhelmine. It seemed to me as if
I heard her speak her last words, and I would repeat
to myself as I glided in terror before her—“O!
beware of rash vows, for it is a vow which
has killed me!”</p>

<div><h1><a id='assin'></a>AN ASSINIBOIN LODGE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> travels of Prince Maximilian, of Wied, in the
interior of North America, give us an interesting account
of the Assiniboin tribe of Indians in the far west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All on a sudden,” he says, describing their visit,
“we heard some musket-shot, which announced a
very interesting scene. The whole prairie was
covered with scattered Indians, whose numerous
dogs drew their sledges with the baggage; a close
body of warriors, about 250 in number, had formed
themselves in the centre, in the manner of two
bodies of infantry, and advanced in quick time toward
the fort. The whole troop commenced a song
consisting of many broken, abrupt tones, like those
of the war-whoop, and resembling the song which
we heard in 1814 from the Russian soldiers. Many
of these warriors had their faces painted all over
with vermillion, others quite black. In their heads
they wore feathers of eagles, or other birds of prey;
some had wolf-skin caps; others had fastened green
leaves around their heads; and long <a id='wolv'></a>wolves’ tails
were hanging down to their heels, as marks of
honor for enemies they had slain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We continue the extract to afford our readers a
description of the manner in which the Assiniboins
erect their rude dwellings. “At noon a band of Indians
had arrived, and twenty-five tents were set up
near the fort. The women, their faces painted red,
soon finished this work, and dug up with their instruments
the clods of turf which lay around the lower
part of the hut. One of these huts, (see the plate in
the present number of “Graham,”) the dwelling of a
chief, was distinguished from the rest. It was
painted of the color of yellow ochre, had a broad,
reddish-brown border below, and on its sides a large
black bear was painted, (something of a caricature,
it must be confessed,) to the head of which, just
above the nose, a piece of red cloth, that fluttered in
the wind, was fastened; doubtless a medicine. We
now saw the women returning in all directions
from the forest, panting under the weight of large
bundles of wood, which were fastened to their
backs.” The scene, brief as it is, affords a characteristic
view of the life of the children of the
prairie.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Evangeline, a Tale of Acadie. By Henry Wordsworth
Longfellow. Boston: Wm. D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We are glad that Professor Longfellow has, in this volume,
produced a poem which, while it indicates his capacity
as a writer, is practically a triumphant answer to various
depreciating criticisms on his writings. It has been said
that his strength lay in small lyrics and didactics; that he
had not sufficient force of feeling and imagination to create
a poem. Here is a long and elaborate effort, extending to
some hundred and sixty pages, where the strictest unity
of effect is combined with great variety of character,
incident, scenery, sentiment, and description. It has been
said that his love of thought, if not his imagery and ideas,
were borrowed from foreign sources, and that he rather
polished than created. Here is a poem almost entirely
American, blooming with flowers, and fragrant with odors
peculiar to his own continent, and reflecting in its beautiful
verse the streams, valleys, and mountains of his
native land. It has been said that a certain foppery and
effeminate elegance characterized his fancy; and that he
dared not trust himself in the delineation of actual homely
objects, where the poetic effect could not be produced by
cunning combinations of words, but must result from the
exercise of a pure and bright imagination. Here is a poem,
in which whole pages are devoted to the delineation of
humble, hearty farmers and mechanics, evincing an almost
Chaucerian trust in things as opposed to words, giving
clear pictures of objects and characters, replete with a
sweet, humane humor, and producing poetry of effect by
intensity and clearness of imaginative conception. Basil,
the blacksmith, and Benedict, are as vivid and true as the
delineations of Crabbe. Any farmer or smith would instantly
recognize them as genuine. Yet the poet, by his
subtil power of discerning the spirit beneath the rough
external appearance, has given them an intrinsic beauty
and dignity which would entitle them to rank with kings.
He has, with a severe simplicity, fixed his gaze steadily on
the human heart and soul, and we recognize in his delineations,
humanity as well as the externals of rural life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Mr. Longfellow has in this poem thus practically
illustrated his possession of rare powers, for which a few
critics have not given him credit, he has also done something
which, from the time of Sidney, has been pronounced
impossible by English criticism—he has written a long
narrative poem in hexameter verse, and managed it so
admirably, that it seems the best he could have chosen
for his purpose. We cannot conceive of the poem as
being recast in heroics, octosyllabics, blank verse, or the
Spenserian stanza, without essential injury to its effect,
and a limitation of its range of character and description.
In this Mr. Longfellow has clearly performed “the impossible;”
and it should be a source of gratification to every
American, that one of his own countrymen has achieved
what no English poet has been able to perform, and what
few have dared to attempt. The composition of a poem
in hexameter verse, which can be read with as much ease
and delight as “Gertrude of Wyoming,” we conceive to
be the most original peculiarity of this original work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of Evangeline is, perhaps, Mr. Longfellow’s
most beautiful creation. It is both conceived and
sustained with wonderful force and truth. The sweetness,
purity, energy, holiness, and naturalness of the character,
as displayed in her life-long wanderings, the unforced
religious elevation which envelopes her, and through her
the whole poem;</p>

which none who once cherishes will willingly let
die. The author has well addressed the class of readers

Mackellar. Phila.: Carey &amp; Hart. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The modest preface of this elegantly printed volume is
enough to smooth the wrinkled front of criticism. The
writer is, we believe, an intelligent printer, who has made
verse the solace, not the occupation of his life. It would
be hard to try his volume by any severe requisitions of criticism.
It is hearty, earnest and genuine, and fairly expresses
what is in the man. The little poem entitled, “The Editor
sat in his Sanctum,” has been very popular. The principal
fault of the author is his habit of disturbing the train of
serious feeling which he often awakens, by some expressions
which trail along with them ludicrous suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes contain upward of ninety biographies,
varying in extent, according to the importance of the subjects

written, and reliable. A book on so important a subject
cannot fail of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best biography in the volume is that of Washington.
From the small space in which the events are crowded,
the writer had not an opportunity to do justice to his
artistical powers, but the view taken of Washington’s
mind is the truest and most original we have ever seen.
Every American who has been accustomed to consider the
Father of his Country, and one of the leaders of his race,
as being a man of great virtues but of moderate talents—a
view which seems to obtain among the warmest eulogists
of Washington—should read the searching and profound
remarks with which the writer precedes his narrative.
There is one slip of the pen, however, which it may be
as well to note. After showing that Washington possessed
the most eminent qualities of mind and feeling, he says,
toward the end, that Hamilton’s “talents took the form of
genius, which Washington’s did not.” The writer should
have recollected that he had been describing a high though
not obvious genius throughout his eloquent and profound
statement; and that he was using the term genius, not in
its primal, but in one of its secondary applications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cooper is so great a favorite with the American
public that any thing coming from his pen will be sought
for with avidity. We do not regard “The Crater” as one
of the best of his works, but coming from almost any other
living writer it would be regarded as extraordinary. The
invention of Mr. Cooper seems to be inexhaustible; age
cannot stale nor custom wither his infinite variety; and
we have in “The Crater,” and especially in the scenes descriptive
of the working of the “Old Rancocus” among
the breakers, evidence that the genius which has won the
admiration of all civilized communities, still holds its wand
with an unrelaxed grasp, and possesses spells powerful as
at the first. His sea-stories surpass those of Smollet even
in power and verisimilitude, while they bear no taint of
his grossness. The best of these, the ocean tale, “Rose
Budd,” now in the course of publication in this Magazine,
has been pronounced, by all who have read it, one of the

The fault was our own, in leaving the article so

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
